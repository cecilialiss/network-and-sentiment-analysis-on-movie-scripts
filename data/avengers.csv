3313,BRUCE BANNER,What does Fury want me to do? Swallow it?,The Avengers
3314,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"He wants you to find it. It’s been taken. It emits a Gamma signature that’s too weak for us to trace. No one knows Gamma radiation like you do. If there was, that’s where I’d be. ",The Avengers

3330,COUNCILMAN,"Which is why you should be focusing on Phase Two, it was designed for exactly this purpose. ",The Avengers

3353,STEVE ROGERS,Who took it from you?,The Avengers
3354,NICK FURY,He’s called Loki. He’s- not from around here. There’s a lot we’ll have to bring you up to speed on if you’re in. The world has gotten even stranger than you already know.,The Avengers
3355,STEVE ROGERS,At this point I doubt anything would surprise me.,The Avengers
3356,NICK FURY,Ten bucks says you’re wrong. There’s a debriefing packet waiting for you back at your apartment. Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract that we ought to know now?,The Avengers

3475,NICK FURY,"Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you’re in the wind. ",The Avengers
3476,BRUCE BANNER,Well where are you with that?,The Avengers
3477,PHIL COULSON,"We’re sweeping every wirelessly accessible camera on the planet. Cell phones... laptops, if it’s connected to a satellite, it’s eyes and ears for us. ",The Avengers
3478,NATASHA ROMANOFF,It’s still not gonna find them in time.,The Avengers
3479,BRUCE BANNER,You have to narrow your field. How many Spectrometers do you have access to?,The Avengers
3480,NICK FURY,How many are there?,The Avengers
3481,BRUCE BANNER,"Call every lab you know. Tell them to put the Spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for Gamma rays. I’ll rough out a tracking algorithm, basic cluster recognition. At least we could rule out a few places. Do you have somewhere for me to work? ",The Avengers
3482,NICK FURY,"Agent Romanoff, would you show Doctor Banner to his laboratory, please?",The Avengers
3483,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"You’re gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys. ",The Avengers
3484,BRUCE BANNER,Really? Do you have the com-meter sixty-four?,The Avengers
3485,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I’m not sure-,The Avengers
3486,BRUCE BANNER,Oh you’re very young.,The Avengers
3487,NICK FURY,"Hill, did you tell the council that Barton had been compromised? ",The Avengers
3488,MARIA HILL,Was that not procedure? Did you tell them who exactly is on your response team?,The Avengers
3489,NICK FURY,Doesn’t appear that I have to.,The Avengers
3490,ERIK SELVIG,Put it over there. Where did you find all these people?,The Avengers
3491,CLINT BARTON,"SHIELD has no shortage of enemies, Doctor. This the stuff you need? ",The Avengers
3492,ERIK SELVIG,"Yeah. Iridium. It’s found in meteorites, it forms anti-protons. It’s very hard to get hold of. ",The Avengers
3493,CLINT BARTON,Especially if SHIELD knows you need it.,The Avengers
3494,ERIK SELVIG,"Well, I didn’t know. Hey! This is wonderful. The Tesseract has shown me so much. It’s- it’s more than knowledge, it’s truth. ",The Avengers
3495,LOKI,"I know. It, ah- it touches everyone differently. What did it show you Agent Barton? ",The Avengers
3496,CLINT BARTON,My next target.,The Avengers
3497,ERIK SELVIG,"Stick in the mud. He’s got no soul. No wonder you chose this, this tomb to work in. ",The Avengers
3498,CLINT BARTON,"Well, the Radisson doesn’t have three levels of lead lined flooring between SHIELD and that Cube.",The Avengers
3499,LOKI,I see why Fury chose you to guard it.,The Avengers
3500,CLINT BARTON,"You’re going to have to contend with him sir. As long as he’s in the air, I can’t pin him down. And he’ll be putting together a team. ",The Avengers
3501,LOKI,Are they a threat?,The Avengers
3502,CLINT BARTON,"To each other more than likely. But if Fury can get ’em on track, and he might, they could throw some noise our way. ",The Avengers
3503,LOKI,You admire Fury.,The Avengers
3504,CLINT BARTON,He’s got a clear line of sight.,The Avengers
3505,LOKI,Is that why you failed to kill him?,The Avengers
3506,CLINT BARTON,"It might be. I was disoriented, and I’m not at my best with a gun. ",The Avengers
3507,LOKI,"I want to know everything you can tell me about this team of his. I would- test their mettle. I am weary of scuttling in shadow. I mean to rule this world, not burrow in it. ",The Avengers
3508,CLINT BARTON,That’s a risk,The Avengers
3509,LOKI,Oh yes.,The Avengers
3510,CLINT BARTON,If you’re set on making yourself known. I could be useful.,The Avengers
3511,LOKI,Tell me what you need.,The Avengers
3512,CLINT BARTON,I need a distraction. And an eyeball.,The Avengers
3513,PHIL COULSON,"I mean, if it’s not too much trouble. ",The Avengers
3514,STEVE ROGERS,"No-no, it’s fine. ",The Avengers
3515,PHIL COULSON,"It’s a vintage set. Took me a couple of years to collect them all. Near mint, slight foxing around the edges but- ",The Avengers
3516,JAPSER SITWELL,"We got a hit. Sixty seven percent match. Wait- cross-match, seventy nine percent. ",The Avengers
3517,PHIL COULSON,Location?,The Avengers
3518,JAPSER SITWELL,"Stuttgart, Germany. Twenty eight, Königstraße. He’s not exactly hiding. ",The Avengers
3519,NICK FURY,"Captain, you’re up.",The Avengers
3520,LOKI,"Kneel before me. I said- KNEEL!  Is not this simpler? Is this not your natural state? It’s the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life’s joy in a mad scramble for power, for identity. You were made- to be ruled. In the end- you will always kneel.",The Avengers
3521,GERMAN OLD MAN,Not to men like you.,The Avengers
3522,LOKI,There are no men like me.,The Avengers
3523,GERMAN OLD MAN,There are always men like you.,The Avengers
3524,LOKI,"Look to your elder, people. Let him be an example.",The Avengers
3525,STEVE ROGERS,"You know, the last time I was in Germany and saw a man standing above everybody else, we ended up disagreeing. ",The Avengers
3526,LOKI,The soldier- the man out of time.,The Avengers
3527,STEVE ROGERS,I’m not the one who’s out of time.,The Avengers
3528,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.",The Avengers
3529,LOKI,Kneel!,The Avengers
3530,STEVE ROGERS,Not today.,The Avengers
3531,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Guy’s all over the place.,The Avengers
3532,TONY STARK,"Agent Romanoff, you miss me? Make a move reindeer games. Good move.",The Avengers
3533,STEVE ROGERS,Mister Stark.,The Avengers
3534,TONY STARK,Captain.,The Avengers
3535,NICK FURY,He saying anything?,The Avengers
3536,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Not a word.,The Avengers
3537,NICK FURY,"Just get him here, we’re low on time. ",The Avengers
3538,STEVE ROGERS,I don’t like it.,The Avengers
3539,TONY STARK,What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?,The Avengers
3540,STEVE ROGERS,I don’t remember it being that easy. This guy packs a wallop.,The Avengers
3541,TONY STARK,"Still, you were pretty spry, for an older fellow. What’s your thing? Pilates? ",The Avengers
3542,STEVE ROGERS,What?,The Avengers
3543,TONY STARK,"It’s like calisthenics. You might have missed a couple of things. Y’know, doing time as a Cap-sicle. ",The Avengers
3544,STEVE ROGERS,Fury didn’t tell me he was calling you in.,The Avengers
3545,TONY STARK,"Yeah, there’s a lot of things Fury doesn’t tell you.",The Avengers
3546,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Where’s this come from?,The Avengers
3547,STEVE ROGERS,What’s the matter? Scared of a little lightening?,The Avengers
3548,LOKI,I’m not overly fond of what follows. ,The Avengers
3549,STEVE ROGERS,What are you doing?,The Avengers
3550,TONY STARK,Now there’s that guy.,The Avengers
3551,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Another Asgardian?,The Avengers
3552,STEVE ROGERS,That guy’s a friendly.,The Avengers
3553,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Doesn’t matter. If he frees Loki, or kills him, the Tesseract’s lost.",The Avengers
3554,STEVE ROGERS,"Stark, we need a plan of attack. ",The Avengers
3555,TONY STARK,I have a plan. Attack!,The Avengers
3556,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I’d sit this one out, Cap. ",The Avengers
3557,STEVE ROGERS,I don’t see how I can.,The Avengers
3558,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"These guys come from legend, they’re basically Gods. ",The Avengers
3559,STEVE ROGERS,"There’s only one God ma’am, and I’m pretty sure he doesn’t dress like that.",The Avengers
3560,THOR,Where is the Tesseract?,The Avengers
3561,LOKI,"Oh-ho, I missed you too. ",The Avengers
3562,THOR,Do I look to be in a gaming mood?,The Avengers
3563,LOKI,"Oh, you should thank me. With the Bifrost gone, how many dark energy did the All-Father have to muster to conjure you here? Your precious Earth.",The Avengers
3564,THOR,I thought you dead.,The Avengers
3565,LOKI,Did you mourn?,The Avengers
3566,THOR,We all did. Our father-,The Avengers
3567,LOKI,"Your father. He did tell you my true parentage, did he not? ",The Avengers
3568,THOR,"We were raised together, we played together, we fought together. Do you remember none of that? ",The Avengers
3569,LOKI,"I remember a shadow, living in the shade of your greatness. I remember you tossing me into an abyss. I who was and should be king! ",The Avengers
3570,THOR,"So you take the world I love as recompense for your imagined slights? No. The Earth is under my protection, Loki. ",The Avengers
3571,LOKI,Well yes.,The Avengers
3572,THOR,"Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother. Throne would suit you ill.",The Avengers
3573,LOKI,"I’ve seen worlds you’ve never known about. I have grown, Odinson, in my exile. I have seen the true power of the Tesseract, and when I wield it- ",The Avengers
3574,THOR,Who showed you this power? Who controls the would-be-king?,The Avengers
3575,LOKI,I am a king!,The Avengers
3576,THOR,Not here. You give up the Tesseract; you give up this poisonous dream! You come home.,The Avengers
3577,LOKI,I don’t have it.  You need the Cube to bring me home but I’ve sent it off I know not where.,The Avengers
3578,THOR,You listen well brother-,The Avengers
3579,LOKI,I’m listening?,The Avengers
3580,THOR,Do not touch me again.,The Avengers
3581,TONY STARK,Then don’t take my stuff.,The Avengers
3582,THOR,You have no idea what you’re dealing with.,The Avengers
3583,TONY STARK,Uh- Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother know you wear-th her drapes?,The Avengers
3584,THOR,"This is beyond you, metal man. Loki will face Asgardian justice. ",The Avengers
3585,TONY STARK,"He gives up the Cube, he’s all yours. -stay out of the way. Tourist. Okay! ",The Avengers
3586,JARVIS,Power at four hundred percent capacity.,The Avengers
3587,TONY STARK,How bout that?,The Avengers
3588,STEVE ROGERS,Hey! That’s enough!  Now I don’t know what you plan on doing here-,The Avengers
3589,THOR,I’ve come here to put an end to Loki’s schemes!,The Avengers
3590,STEVE ROGERS,Then prove it. Put that hammer down.,The Avengers
3591,TONY STARK,"Uh, yeah! No! Bad call, he loves his hammer- ",The Avengers
3592,THOR,You want me to put hammer down?,The Avengers
3593,STEVE ROGERS,Are we done here?,The Avengers
3594,NICK FURY,"In case it’s unclear, you try to escape- you so much as scratch that glass- Thirty thousand feet straight down in a steel trap. You get how that works? Ant. Boot. ",The Avengers
3595,LOKI,"It’s an impressive cage. Not built, I think, for me. ",The Avengers
3596,NICK FURY,Built for something a lot stronger than you.,The Avengers
3597,LOKI,"Oh I’ve heard. A mindless beast- makes play he’s still a man... How desperate are you, that you call on such lost creatures to defend you? ",The Avengers
3598,NICK FURY,"How desperate am I?... You threaten my world with war, you steal a force you can’t hope to control, you talk about peace and you kill ’cause it’s fun. You have made me very desperate. You might not be glad that you did. ",The Avengers
3599,LOKI,"Ooh. It burns you to have come so close, to have the Tesseract, to have power- unlimited power, and for what? A... warm light for all mankind to share? And then to be reminded what real power is.",The Avengers
3600,NICK FURY,"Well, let me know if ’real power’ wants a magazine or something. ",The Avengers
3601,BRUCE BANNER,He really grows on you doesn’t he?,The Avengers
3602,STEVE ROGERS,"Loki’s gonna drag this out. So, Thor, what’s his play? ",The Avengers
3603,THOR,"He has an army called the Chitauri. They’re not of Asgard nor any world known. He means to lead the against your people. They will win him the Earth, in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract. ",The Avengers
3604,STEVE ROGERS,"An army, from outer space? ",The Avengers
3605,BRUCE BANNER,"So, he’s building another portal. That’s what he needs Erik Selvig for. ",The Avengers
3606,THOR,Selvig?,The Avengers
3607,BRUCE BANNER,He’s an astrophysicist.,The Avengers
3608,THOR,He’s a friend.,The Avengers
3609,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Loki has them under some kind of spell- along with one of ours.,The Avengers
3610,STEVE ROGERS,I wanna know why Loki let us take him. He’s not leading an army from here.,The Avengers
3611,BRUCE BANNER,"I don’t think we should be focusing on Loki. That guy’s brain is a bag full of cats, you can small crazy on him. ",The Avengers
3612,THOR,"Have care how you speak. Loki is beyond reason but he is of Asgard, and he is my brother. ",The Avengers
3613,NATASHA ROMANOFF,He killed eighty people in two days.,The Avengers
3614,THOR,He’s adopted?,The Avengers
3615,BRUCE BANNER,"I think it’s about the mechanics. Iridium, what do they need the Iridium for?",The Avengers
3616,TONY STARK,"It’s a stabilizing agent. I’m saying, take a weekend; I’ll fly you to Portland. Keep love alive. Means the portal won’t collapse on itself like it did at SHIELD. No hard feelings point break, you got a mean swing. Also, means the portal can open as wide and stay open as long as Loki wants. Ah, raise the mizzen mast, ship the topsails. That man is playing Galaga! Thought we wouldn’t notice, but we did. How does Fury even see these? ",The Avengers
3617,MARIA HILL,He turns!,The Avengers
3618,TONY STARK,"Sounds exhausting! The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily. Only major component he still needs is a power source- of high energy density. Something to- kick start the Cube. ",The Avengers
3619,MARIA HILL,When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?,The Avengers
3620,TONY STARK,"Last night. The packet, Selvig’s notes, the extraction theory papers- am I the only one who did the reading? ",The Avengers
3621,STEVE ROGERS,Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?,The Avengers
3622,BRUCE BANNER,He’s have to heat the Cube to a hundred and twenty million kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier.,The Avengers
3623,TONY STARK,"Unless, Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the Quantum Tunneling effect. ",The Avengers
3624,BRUCE BANNER,"Well, if he could do that he could achieve heavy-ion fusion at any reactor on the planet. ",The Avengers
3625,TONY STARK,Finally. Someone who speaks English.,The Avengers
3626,STEVE ROGERS,Is that what just happened?,The Avengers
3627,TONY STARK,"It’s good to meet you, Doctor Banner. Your work on anti-electronic collisions is unparalleled. And I’m a huge fan of the way you- lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster. ",The Avengers
3628,BRUCE BANNER,...Thanks.,The Avengers
3629,NICK FURY,Doctor Banner is only here to track the Cube. I was hoping you might join him.,The Avengers
3630,STEVE ROGERS,I’d start with that stick of his. It may be magical but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon.,The Avengers
3631,NICK FURY,"I don’t know about that, but it is powered by the Cube. And I like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys. ",The Avengers
3632,THOR,Monkeys? I do not understand-,The Avengers
3633,STEVE ROGERS,I do! I...I understood that reference.,The Avengers
3634,TONY STARK,"Shall we play, Doctor? ",The Avengers
3635,BRUCE BANNER,"This way, sir. The Gamma readings are definitely consistent with Selvig’s reports on the Tesseract. But it’s gonna take weeks to process.",The Avengers
3636,TONY STARK,If we bypass their mainframe and direct route to the Homer cluster we can clock this at around six hundred teraflops.,The Avengers
3637,BRUCE BANNER,All I packed was a toothbrush.,The Avengers
3638,TONY STARK,"You know, you should come by Stark Tower some time. Top ten floors- all R and D. You’d love it, it’s a candy land. ",The Avengers
3639,BRUCE BANNER,Thanks but...last time I was in New York I kind of broke...Harlem.,The Avengers
3640,TONY STARK,"Well, I promise a stress free environment. No tension, no surprises. He zaps Banner in the side. ",The Avengers
3641,BRUCE BANNER,Ow!,The Avengers
3642,STEVE ROGERS,Hey!,The Avengers
3643,TONY STARK,Nothing?,The Avengers
3644,STEVE ROGERS,Are you nuts?,The Avengers
3645,TONY STARK,"Jury’s out! You really have got a lid on it, haven’t you? What’s your secret? Mellow jazz, bongo drums, huge bag of weed? ",The Avengers
3646,STEVE ROGERS,Is everything a joke to you?,The Avengers
3647,TONY STARK,Funny things are.,The Avengers
3648,STEVE ROGERS,"Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn’t funny. No offense, Doc. ",The Avengers
3649,BRUCE BANNER,No it’s alright. I wouldn’t have come aboard if I couldn’t handle pointy things.,The Avengers
3650,TONY STARK,"You’re tip-toeing, big man. You need to strut. ",The Avengers
3651,STEVE ROGERS,"And you need to focus on the problem, Mister Stark. ",The Avengers
3652,TONY STARK,"You think I’m not? Why did Fury call us in? Why now, why not before? What isn’t he telling us? I can’t do the equation unless I have all the variables. ",The Avengers
3653,STEVE ROGERS,You think Fury’s hiding something?,The Avengers
3654,TONY STARK,"He’s a spy. Captain, he’s the spy. His secrets have secrets. It’s bugging him to, isn’t it? ",The Avengers
3655,BRUCE BANNER,"Uh, Aah, I just wanna finish my work here and- ",The Avengers
3656,STEVE ROGERS,Doctor?,The Avengers
3657,BRUCE BANNER,"A warm light for all mankind,"" Loki’s jab at Fury about the Cube. ",The Avengers
3658,STEVE ROGERS,I heard it.,The Avengers
3659,BRUCE BANNER,"Well, I think that was meant for you.  Even if Barton didn’t tell Loki about the tower, it was still all over the news. ",The Avengers
3660,STEVE ROGERS,The Stark Tower? That big ugly building in New York?,The Avengers
3661,BRUCE BANNER,"It’s powered by an arc reactor, self-sustaining energy source. That building will run itself for, what, a year? ",The Avengers
3662,TONY STARK,"It’s just the prototype. I’m kind of the only name in clean energy right now, that’s what he’s getting at. ",The Avengers
3663,BRUCE BANNER,"So, why didn’t SHIELD bring him in on the Tesseract project? What are they even doing in the energy business in the first place? ",The Avengers
3664,TONY STARK,I should probably look into that as soon as my decryption program finishes breaking into all of SHIELD’s secure files.,The Avengers
3665,STEVE ROGERS,I’m sorry did you say-,The Avengers
3666,TONY STARK,JARVIS has been running it since I hit the bridge. In a few hours I’ll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide. Blueberry?,The Avengers
3667,STEVE ROGERS,Yet you’re confused about why they didn’t want you around.,The Avengers
3668,TONY STARK,"An intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically, not awesome. ",The Avengers
3669,STEVE ROGERS,"I think Loki’s trying to wind us up. This is a man who means to start a war and if we don’t stay focused he’ll succeed. We have orders, we should follow them. ",The Avengers
3670,TONY STARK,Following’s not really my style.,The Avengers
3671,STEVE ROGERS,"And you’re all about style, aren’t you? ",The Avengers
3672,TONY STARK,"Out of the people in this room, which one is ""A"" wearing a spangly outfit and ""B"" not of use? ",The Avengers
3673,BRUCE BANNER,"Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you? ",The Avengers
3674,STEVE ROGERS,Just find the Cube.,The Avengers
3675,TONY STARK,That’s the guy my dad never shut up about? Wondering if they shouldn’t have kept him on ice.,The Avengers
3676,BRUCE BANNER,"Guy’s not wrong about Loki, he does have the jump on us. ",The Avengers
3677,TONY STARK,"What he’s got is an ACME dynamite kit. It’s gonna blow up in his face, and I’m gonna be there when it does. ",The Avengers
3678,BRUCE BANNER,I’ll read all about it.,The Avengers
3679,TONY STARK,"Mhm, or, you’ll be suiting up with the rest of us. ",The Avengers
3680,BRUCE BANNER,"Now, you see I don’t get a suit of armor. I’m exposed, like a nerve, it’s a nightmare. ",The Avengers
3681,TONY STARK,"You know, I’ve got a cluster shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart. This stops it- He taps the arc reactor. -this little circle of light. It’s part of me now, not just armor. It’s a terrible privilege. ",The Avengers
3682,BRUCE BANNER,But you can control it.,The Avengers
3683,TONY STARK,Because I learned how.,The Avengers
3684,BRUCE BANNER,It’s different. ,The Avengers
3685,TONY STARK,"Hey, I read all about your accident. That much Gamma exposure- should’ve killed you. ",The Avengers
3686,BRUCE BANNER,So you’re saying that the Hulk- the Other Guy- saved my life? That’s nice. That’s nice sentiment. Saved it for- what?,The Avengers
3687,TONY STARK,I guess we’ll find out.,The Avengers
3688,BRUCE BANNER,You may not enjoy that.,The Avengers
3689,TONY STARK,And you just might.,The Avengers
3690,PHIL COULSON,"As soon as Loki took the doctor we... ...moved Jane Foster. We’ve got an excellent observatory in Tromsø. She was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday. Handsome fee, private plane, very remote. She’ll be safe. ",The Avengers
3691,THOR,Thank you. It’s no accident Loki taking Erik Selvig. I dread what he plans for him once he’s done. Erik is a good man.,The Avengers
3692,PHIL COULSON,He talks about you a lot. You changed his life. You changed everything around here.,The Avengers
3693,THOR,"They were better as they were. We pretend on Asgard that we’re more advanced, but we- we come here battling like Bildschneip. ",The Avengers
3694,PHIL COULSON,Like what?,The Avengers
3695,THOR,"Bildschneip. You know, huge, scaly, big antlers. You don’t have those? ",The Avengers
3696,PHIL COULSON,No.,The Avengers
3697,THOR,"Huh! Well they are repulsive, and they trample everything in their path.  When I first came to earth, Loki’s rage followed me here and your people paid the price. And now again. In my youth I courted war. ",The Avengers
3698,NICK FURY,War hasn’t started yet. You think you can make Loki tell us where the Tesseract is?,The Avengers
3699,THOR,"I do not know. Loki’s mind is far afield, it’s not just power he craves, it’s vengeance upon me. There’s no pain would prise his need from him. ",The Avengers
3700,NICK FURY,"A lot of guys think that, until the pain starts. ",The Avengers
3701,THOR,What are you asking me to do?,The Avengers
3702,NICK FURY,"I’m asking, what are you prepared to do? ",The Avengers
3703,THOR,Loki is a prisoner.,The Avengers
3704,NICK FURY,Then why do I feel like he’s the only person on this boat that wants to be here?,The Avengers
3705,LOKI,Hm. There’s not many people that can sneak up on me.,The Avengers
3706,NATASHA ROMANOFF,But you figured I’d come.,The Avengers
3707,LOKI,"After. After whatever tortures Fury can concoct, you would appear as a friend, as a balm. And I would cooperate. ",The Avengers
3708,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I wanna know what you’ve done to Agent Barton.,The Avengers
3709,LOKI,I’d say I’ve expanded his mind.,The Avengers
3710,NATASHA ROMANOFF,And once you’ve won. Once you’re king of the mountain. What happens to his mind?,The Avengers
3711,LOKI,"Is this love, Agent Romanoff? ",The Avengers
3712,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Love is for children. I owe him a debt.,The Avengers
3713,LOKI,Tell me.,The Avengers
3714,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Before I worked for SHIELD, I uh- well, I made a name for myself. I have a very specific skill set. I didn’t care who I used it for, or on. I got on SHIELD’s radar in a bad way. Agent Barton was sent to kill me, he made a different call. ",The Avengers
3715,LOKI,And what will you do if I vow to spare him?,The Avengers
3716,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Not let you out.,The Avengers
3717,LOKI,"Ah, no. But I like this. Your world in the balance, and you bargain for one man? ",The Avengers
3718,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Regime’s fall everyday. I tend not to weep over that, I’m Russian, or I was. ",The Avengers
3719,LOKI,And what are you now?,The Avengers
3720,NATASHA ROMANOFF,It’s really not that complicated. I got red in my ledger. I’d like to wipe it out.,The Avengers
3721,LOKI,"Can you? Can you wipe out that much red? Drakov’s daughter? Sao Paulo? The hospital fire? Barton told me everything. Your ledger is dripping, it’s gushing red, and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything? This is the basest sentimentality. This is a child, a prayer. Pathetic. ...You lie and kill in the service of liars... ...and killers. You pretend to be separate, to have your own code... ...something that makes up for the horrors. But they are a part of you, and they will never go away. I won’t touch Barton! Not until I make him kill you. Slowly, intimately, in every way he knows you fear.  And then he’ll wake just long enough to see his good work, and when he screams I’ll split his skull! This is my bargain, you mewling quim! ",The Avengers
3722,NATASHA ROMANOFF,You’re a monster!,The Avengers
3723,LOKI,"Oh, no. You brought the monster.",The Avengers
3724,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"So, Banner? That’s your play. ",The Avengers
3725,LOKI,What?,The Avengers
3726,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Loki means to unleash the Hulk. Keep Banner in the lab, I’m on my way. Send Thor as well. Thank you, for your cooperation!",The Avengers
3727,NICK FURY,"What are you doing, Mr. Stark? ",The Avengers

3748,STEVE ROGERS,Like you controlled the cube!,The Avengers
3749,THOR,"Your work with the Tesseract is what drew Loki to it, and his allies. It is the signal to all the realms that the earth is ready for A HIGHER FORM OF WAR. ",The Avengers

Our communications, location of the cube, Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you. Lost my one good eye. Think I had that coming.  Yes, we were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract. I never put all my chips on that number, though, because I was playing something even riskier. There was an idea, Stark knows this, called the Avengers Initiative.   The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people, see if they could become something more. See if they could work together when we needed them to, to fight the battles that we never could. Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea, in heroes.  Well, it’s an old fashioned notion.",The Avengers
