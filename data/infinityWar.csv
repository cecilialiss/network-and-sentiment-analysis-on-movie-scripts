13260,THOR,Not anymore.,Avengers: Infinity War
13261,GAMORA,Thor… why would he go to Knowhere?,Avengers: Infinity War
13262,THOR,"Because for years, the Reality Stone has been safely stored, there with a man we call the Collector.",Avengers: Infinity War
13263,PETER QUILL,"If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe. Only an idiot would give that man a stone.",Avengers: Infinity War
13264,THOR,Or a genius.,Avengers: Infinity War
13265,GAMORA,How do you know he's not going for one of the other Stones?,Avengers: Infinity War
13266,THOR,"There's six stones out there.  Thanos already has the Power Stone because he stole it last week, when he decimated Xandar. He stole the Space Stone from me when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people. The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth. They're with the Avengers.",Avengers: Infinity War
13267,PETER QUILL,The 'Avengers'?,Avengers: Infinity War
13268,THOR,Earth's Mightiest Heroes.,Avengers: Infinity War
13269,MANTIS,Like Kevin Bacon?,Avengers: Infinity War
13270,THOR,"He may be on the team. I don't know. Haven't been there in a while. As for the Soul Stone, well, no one's ever seen that. No one even knows where it is. Therefore, Thanos can't get it. Therefore, he's going to Knowhere. Hence, he'll be getting the Reality Stone. You're welcome.",Avengers: Infinity War
13271,GAMORA,Then we have to go to Knowhere now.,Avengers: Infinity War
13272,THOR,"Wrong! Where we have to go, is Nivadellir.",Avengers: Infinity War
13273,DRAX,That's a made up word.,Avengers: Infinity War
13274,THOR,All words are made up.,Avengers: Infinity War
13275,ROCKET,"Hold up, Nidavellir is real?  Seriously? I mean, that place is a legend.  They make the most powerful, horrific weapons to ever torment the Universe. I would very much like to go there, please.",Avengers: Infinity War
13276,THOR,"The rabbit is correct, and clearly the smartest among you.",Avengers: Infinity War
13277,ROCKET,Rabbit?,Avengers: Infinity War
13278,THOR,"Only Eitri the dwarf king can make me the weapon I need.  I assume you're the captain, sir?",Avengers: Infinity War
13279,ROCKET,You're very perceptive.,Avengers: Infinity War
13280,THOR,You seem like a noble leader. Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?,Avengers: Infinity War
13281,ROCKET,"Lemme just ask the captain. Oh, wait a second, it's me! Yeah, I'll go.",Avengers: Infinity War
13282,THOR,Wonderful.,Avengers: Infinity War
13283,PETER QUILL,Except for that I'm the captain.,Avengers: Infinity War
13284,THOR,Quiet!,Avengers: Infinity War
13285,PETER QUILL,That's my backpack.,Avengers: Infinity War
13286,ROCKET,Go sit down.,Avengers: Infinity War
13287,PETER QUILL,"Look, this is my ship. And I'm not goin' to…  Wait, what kind of weapon are we talking about here?",Avengers: Infinity War
13288,THOR,The Thanos killing kind.,Avengers: Infinity War
13289,PETER QUILL,Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?,Avengers: Infinity War
13290,THOR,No. You simply lack the strength to wield them. Your bodies will crumble as your minds collapse into the madness.,Avengers: Infinity War
13291,ROCKET,Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now?,Avengers: Infinity War
13292,THOR,A little bit. Yeah.,Avengers: Infinity War
13293,GAMORA,"If we don't go to Knowhere and Thanos retrieves another stone, he'll be too powerful to stop.",Avengers: Infinity War
13294,THOR,He already is.,Avengers: Infinity War
13295,ROCKET,"I got it figured out. We got two ships, and a large assortment of morons. So me and Groot will go with the pirate-angel here, and the morons will go to Knowhere to try and stop Thanos. Cool? Cool.",Avengers: Infinity War
13296,THOR,So cool.,Avengers: Infinity War
13297,PETER QUILL,For the record… I know that you're only going with him because it's where Thanos isn't.,Avengers: Infinity War
13298,ROCKET,"You know, you shouldn't talk that way to your captain, Quill.  Come on, Groot. Put that game down, you'll rot your brain.",Avengers: Infinity War
13299,THOR,"I bid you farewell and good luck, morons. Bye.",Avengers: Infinity War
13300,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Vis? Is it the stone again?,Avengers: Infinity War
13301,VISION,It's as if it's speaking to me.,Avengers: Infinity War
13302,WANDA MAXIMOFF,What does it say?,Avengers: Infinity War
13303,VISION,I don't... I don't know. But something... Tell me what you feel.,Avengers: Infinity War
13304,WANDA MAXIMOFF,I just feel you. So there's a 10 AM to Glasgow to give us more time together before you went back.,Avengers: Infinity War
13305,VISION,What if I miss that train?,Avengers: Infinity War
13306,WANDA MAXIMOFF,There is an 11.,Avengers: Infinity War
13307,VISION,"What if I missed all the trains? What if this time, I didn't go back?",Avengers: Infinity War
13308,WANDA MAXIMOFF,You gave Stark your word.,Avengers: Infinity War
13309,VISION,I'd rather give it to you.,Avengers: Infinity War
13310,WANDA MAXIMOFF,"There are people who are expecting me too, you know. We both made promises.",Avengers: Infinity War
13311,VISION,"Not to each other.  Wanda… for two years, we've stolen these moments, trying to see if this could work. And... I don't know.  You know what, I'm just gonna speak for myself -- I, I... I think...",Avengers: Infinity War
13312,WANDA MAXIMOFF,It works.,Avengers: Infinity War
13313,VISION,It works. Then stay. Stay with me. Or not. If I'm overstepping…,Avengers: Infinity War
13314,WANDA MAXIMOFF,What are they?,Avengers: Infinity War
13315,VISION,What the stone was warning me about.  I have to go.,Avengers: Infinity War
13316,WANDA MAXIMOFF,"No, Vision. Vision, if that's true… then maybe going isn't the best idea.",Avengers: Infinity War
13317,VISION,"Wanda, I…",Avengers: Infinity War
13318,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Vision!,Avengers: Infinity War
13319,VISION,The blade. It stopped me from phasing.,Avengers: Infinity War
13320,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Is that even possible?,Avengers: Infinity War
13321,VISION,It isn't supposed to be.  My systems are failing.  I'm beginning to think... we should have stayed in bed.,Avengers: Infinity War
13322,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Vis!,Avengers: Infinity War
13323,CORVUS GLAIVE,"Give up the Stone, and she lives.",Avengers: Infinity War
13324,WANDA MAXIMOFF,"Hands off. Come on. Come on. Come on, you gotta get up. You gotta get up. Come on. Hey. Hey. We have to go.",Avengers: Infinity War
13325,VISION,Please. Please leave.,Avengers: Infinity War
13326,WANDA MAXIMOFF,You asked me to stay.... I'm staying.,Avengers: Infinity War
13327,VISION,Please.,Avengers: Infinity War
13328,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Get up.,Avengers: Infinity War
13329,PROXIMA MIDNIGHT,Get up.,Avengers: Infinity War
13330,CORVUS GLAIVE,I can't.,Avengers: Infinity War
13331,NATASHA ROMANOFF,We don't wanna kill you. But we will.,Avengers: Infinity War
13332,PROXIMA MIDNIGHT,You'll never get the chance again.,Avengers: Infinity War
13333,SAM WILSON,Can you stand?,Avengers: Infinity War
13334,VISION,"Thank you, Captain.",Avengers: Infinity War
13335,STEVE ROGERS,Let's get you on the jet.,Avengers: Infinity War
13336,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I thought we had a deal. Stay close, check in. Don't take any chances.",Avengers: Infinity War
13337,WANDA MAXIMOFF,I'm sorry. We just wanted time.,Avengers: Infinity War
13338,SAM WILSON,"Where to, Cap?",Avengers: Infinity War
13339,STEVE ROGERS,Home.,Avengers: Infinity War
13340,GAMORA'S MOTHER,Shh. We'll be safe. We'll be safe.,Avengers: Infinity War
13341,EBONY MAW,Zehobereians…,Avengers: Infinity War
13342,YOUNG GAMORA,Mother! Where's my mother?!,Avengers: Infinity War
13343,EBONY MAW,"Zen-Whoberis... Choose a side, or die.",Avengers: Infinity War
13344,YOUNG GAMORA,Mother!,Avengers: Infinity War
13345,EBONY MAW,"One side is a revelation. The other, an honor known only to a few.",Avengers: Infinity War
13346,THANOS,"What's wrong, little one?",Avengers: Infinity War
13347,YOUNG GAMORA,My mother. Where is my mother?,Avengers: Infinity War
13348,THANOS,What's your name?,Avengers: Infinity War
13349,YOUNG GAMORA,Gamora.,Avengers: Infinity War
13350,THANOS,"You're quite the fighter, Gamora. Come. Let me help you.  Look. Pretty, isn't it? Perfectly balanced. As all things should be. Too much to one side, or the other…  Here. You try.",Avengers: Infinity War
13351,EBONY MAW,"Now go in peace, and meet your Maker.",Avengers: Infinity War
13352,THANOS,Concentrate. There! You've got it.,Avengers: Infinity War
13353,PETER QUILL,"Gamora. Do you know if these grenades are the ""blow off your junk"" kind or the gas kind? 'Cause I was thinking I might hang a couple on my belt right here. But I don't want to--",Avengers: Infinity War
13354,GAMORA,I need to ask a favor.,Avengers: Infinity War
13355,PETER QUILL,"Yeah, sure.",Avengers: Infinity War
13356,GAMORA,"One way or another, the path that we're on leads to Thanos.",Avengers: Infinity War
13357,PETER QUILL,Which is what the grenades are for.  I'm sorry. What's the favor?,Avengers: Infinity War
13358,GAMORA,If things go wrong… If Thanos gets me… I want you to promise me… you'll kill me.,Avengers: Infinity War
13359,PETER QUILL,What?,Avengers: Infinity War
13360,GAMORA,I know something he doesn't. If he finds out… the entire Universe could be at risk.,Avengers: Infinity War
13361,PETER QUILL,What do you know?,Avengers: Infinity War
13362,GAMORA,"If I tell you, you'd know, too.",Avengers: Infinity War
13363,PETER QUILL,"If it's so important, shouldn't I?",Avengers: Infinity War
13364,GAMORA,Only if you wanna die.,Avengers: Infinity War
13365,PETER QUILL,Why does somebody always have to die in this scenario?,Avengers: Infinity War
13366,GAMORA,"Just… trust me. And possibly, kill me.",Avengers: Infinity War
13367,PETER QUILL,"I mean, I'd like to. I really would…",Avengers: Infinity War
13368,GAMORA,Swear to me. Swear to me on your mother.,Avengers: Infinity War
13369,PETER QUILL,Okay. Dude. How long have you been standing there?,Avengers: Infinity War
13370,DRAX,An hour.,Avengers: Infinity War
13371,PETER QUILL,An hour? Are you serious?,Avengers: Infinity War
13372,DRAX,I've mastered the ability of standing so incredibly still... that I become invisible to the eye... watch.,Avengers: Infinity War
13373,PETER QUILL,You're eating a zarg-nut.,Avengers: Infinity War
13374,DRAX,But my movement... was so slow... that it's imperceptible.,Avengers: Infinity War
13375,PETER QUILL,"Mmm, no.",Avengers: Infinity War
13376,DRAX,I'm sure I'm invisible.,Avengers: Infinity War
13377,MANTIS,"Hi, Drax.",Avengers: Infinity War
13378,DRAX,Damn it.,Avengers: Infinity War
13379,PETER QUILL,This place looks deserted.,Avengers: Infinity War
13380,DRAX,I'm reading movement from the third quadrant.,Avengers: Infinity War
13381,PETER QUILL,"Yep. I'm picking that up, too. Let's put it down right here.",Avengers: Infinity War
13382,COLLECTOR,I don't have it.,Avengers: Infinity War
13383,THANOS,"Everyone in the Galaxy knows you'd sell your own brother if you thought it would add the slightest trinket to your pathetic collection. I know you have the Reality Stone, Tivan. Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering.",Avengers: Infinity War
13384,COLLECTOR,I told you. I sold it. Why would I lie?,Avengers: Infinity War
13385,THANOS,I imagine it's like breathing for you.,Avengers: Infinity War
13386,COLLECTOR,Like suicide.,Avengers: Infinity War
13387,THANOS,So you do understand. Not even you would surrender something so precious.,Avengers: Infinity War
13388,COLLECTOR,I didn't know what it was.,Avengers: Infinity War
13389,THANOS,"Then you're more of a fool than I took you for. Last chance, charlatan. Where's the Stone?",Avengers: Infinity War
13390,DRAX,Today...,Avengers: Infinity War
13391,PETER QUILL,Drax. Drax.,Avengers: Infinity War
13392,DRAX,...He pays for the deaths of my wife and daughter.,Avengers: Infinity War
13393,PETER QUILL,"Drax, waaaaait!  Not yet, not yet, not yet.  Drax, Drax, Drax. He doesn't have the Stone yet. We get it, and then we can stop him. We have to get the Stone first. Yeah.",Avengers: Infinity War
13394,DRAX,No. No. For Ovette. For Camaria.,Avengers: Infinity War
13395,MANTIS,Sleeeep.,Avengers: Infinity War
13396,PETER QUILL,"Okay. Gamora, Mantis, you go right. I'm...  The other right!",Avengers: Infinity War
13397,THANOS,Why?  Why you? Daughter…,Avengers: Infinity War
13398,PETER QUILL,That was quick.,Avengers: Infinity War
13399,COLLECTOR,Magnificent! Magnificent! Magnificent!,Avengers: Infinity War
13400,THANOS,"Is it sadness I sense in you, daughter? In my heart, I knew you still cared. But one ever knows for sure. Reality is often disappointing. That is, it was. Now… reality can be whatever I want.",Avengers: Infinity War
13401,GAMORA,You knew I'd come.,Avengers: Infinity War
13402,THANOS,"I counted on it. There's something we need to discuss, little one.",Avengers: Infinity War
13403,DRAX,Thanos!,Avengers: Infinity War
13404,PETER QUILL,"Let her go, Grimace!",Avengers: Infinity War
13405,GAMORA,Peter…,Avengers: Infinity War
13406,PETER QUILL,I told you to go right.,Avengers: Infinity War
13407,GAMORA,Now? Really?,Avengers: Infinity War
13408,PETER QUILL,You let her go!,Avengers: Infinity War
13409,THANOS,"Ah, the boyfriend.",Avengers: Infinity War
13410,PETER QUILL,I like to think of myself more as a Titan-killing long-term booty call. Let her go.,Avengers: Infinity War
13411,GAMORA,Peter…,Avengers: Infinity War
13412,PETER QUILL,Or I'm gonna blow that nut sack of a chin right off your face!,Avengers: Infinity War
13413,GAMORA,Not him. You promised! You promised.,Avengers: Infinity War
13414,THANOS,"Oh, daughter. You expect too much from him.  She's asked, hasn't she? Do it.  DO IT!!",Avengers: Infinity War
13415,PETER QUILL,I told you to go right.,Avengers: Infinity War
13416,GAMORA,"I love you, more than anything.",Avengers: Infinity War
13417,PETER QUILL,"I love you, too.",Avengers: Infinity War
13418,THANOS,I like you.,Avengers: Infinity War
13419,SECRETARY ROSS,Still no word from Vision?,Avengers: Infinity War
13420,JAMES RHODES,Satellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh.,Avengers: Infinity War
13421,SECRETARY ROSS,On a stolen Quinjet with four of the world's most wanted criminals.,Avengers: Infinity War
13422,JAMES RHODES,"You know they're only criminals because you've chosen to call them that, right, sir?",Avengers: Infinity War
13423,SECRETARY ROSS,"My God, Rhodes, your talent for horseshit rivals my own.",Avengers: Infinity War
13424,JAMES RHODES,"If it weren't for those Accords, Vision would've been right here.",Avengers: Infinity War
13425,SECRETARY ROSS,"I remember your signature on those papers, Colonel.",Avengers: Infinity War
13426,JAMES RHODES,That's right. And I'm pretty sure I've paid for that.,Avengers: Infinity War
13427,SECRETARY ROSS,You have second thoughts?,Avengers: Infinity War
13428,JAMES RHODES,Not anymore.,Avengers: Infinity War
13429,STEVE ROGERS,Mr. Secretary.,Avengers: Infinity War
13430,SECRETARY ROSS,You got some nerve. I'll give you that.,Avengers: Infinity War
13431,NATASHA ROMANOFF,You could use some of that right now.,Avengers: Infinity War
13432,SECRETARY ROSS,"The world's on fire. And you think, all is forgiven?",Avengers: Infinity War
13433,STEVE ROGERS,"I'm not looking for forgiveness. And I'm way past asking for permission. Earth just lost her best defender. So we're here to fight.  And if you wanna stand in our way... we'll fight you, too.",Avengers: Infinity War
13434,SECRETARY ROSS,Arrest them.,Avengers: Infinity War
13435,JAMES RHODES,"All over it.  That's a court-martial. It's great to see you, Cap.",Avengers: Infinity War
13436,STEVE ROGERS,"You too, Rhodey.",Avengers: Infinity War
13437,JAMES RHODES,Well. You guys really look like crap. Must've been a rough couple of years.,Avengers: Infinity War
13438,SAM WILSON,"Yeah, well, the hotels weren't exactly five star.",Avengers: Infinity War
13439,BRUCE BANNER,"Uh, I think you look great.  Uh... heh... Yeah. I'm back.",Avengers: Infinity War
13440,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Hi, Bruce.",Avengers: Infinity War
13441,BRUCE BANNER,Nat.,Avengers: Infinity War
13442,SAM WILSON,This is awkward.,Avengers: Infinity War
13443,JAMES RHODES,"So we gotta assume they're coming back, right?",Avengers: Infinity War
13444,WANDA MAXIMOFF,And they can clearly find us.,Avengers: Infinity War
13445,BRUCE BANNER,We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?,Avengers: Infinity War
13446,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"After the whole Accords situation, he and Scott took a deal. It was too tough on their families, they're on house arrest.",Avengers: Infinity War
13447,BRUCE BANNER,Who's Scott?,Avengers: Infinity War
13448,STEVE ROGERS,Ant-Man.,Avengers: Infinity War
13449,BRUCE BANNER,"There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man? Okay, look… Thanos has the biggest army in the universe. And he is not gonna stop until he... he gets... Vision's Stone.",Avengers: Infinity War
13450,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Well then, we have to protect it.",Avengers: Infinity War
13451,VISION,"No, we have to destroy it. I've been giving a good deal of thought to this entity in my head, about its nature. But also, its composition. I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something, very similar to its own signature, perhaps… its molecular integrity could fail.",Avengers: Infinity War
13452,WANDA MAXIMOFF,"And you, with it. We're not having this conversation.",Avengers: Infinity War
13453,VISION,Eliminating the stone is the only way to be certain that Thanos can't get it.,Avengers: Infinity War
13454,WANDA MAXIMOFF,That's too high a price.,Avengers: Infinity War
13455,VISION,Only you have the power to pay it.  Thanos threatens half the Universe. One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him.,Avengers: Infinity War
13456,STEVE ROGERS,"But it should.  We don't trade lives, Vision.",Avengers: Infinity War
13457,VISION,"Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life to save how many millions of people. Tell me, why is this any different?",Avengers: Infinity War
13458,BRUCE BANNER,"Because you might have a choice. Your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays. J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron, Tony, me, the Stone. All of them mixed together. All of them learning from one another.",Avengers: Infinity War
13459,WANDA MAXIMOFF,You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?,Avengers: Infinity War
13460,BRUCE BANNER,"I'm saying that if we take out the stone, there's still a whole lot of Vision left. Perhaps the best parts.",Avengers: Infinity War
13461,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Can we do that?,Avengers: Infinity War
13462,BRUCE BANNER,Not me. Not here.,Avengers: Infinity War
13463,JAMES RHODES,"You better find someone, and somewhere fast. Ross isn't exactly just gonna let you guys have your old rooms back.",Avengers: Infinity War
13464,STEVE ROGERS,I know somewhere.,Avengers: Infinity War
13465,OKOYE,"You'll have the Kingsguard, and the Dora Milaje have been alerted.",Avengers: Infinity War
13466,T'CHALLA,And the Border Tribe?,Avengers: Infinity War
13467,OKOYE,Those that are left.,Avengers: Infinity War
13468,T'CHALLA,Send word to the Jabari as well. M'Baku likes a good fight.,Avengers: Infinity War
13469,OKOYE,And what of this one?,Avengers: Infinity War
13470,T'CHALLA,This one may be tired of war.  But the White Wolf has rested long enough.,Avengers: Infinity War
13471,BUCKY BARNES,Where's the fight?,Avengers: Infinity War
13472,T'CHALLA,On its way.,Avengers: Infinity War
13473,EBONY MAW,"In all the time I've served Thanos, I've never failed him. If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan with the Time Stone still attached to your vaguely irritating person, there would be... judgement.  Give me... the stone.",Avengers: Infinity War
13474,TONY STARK,"Wow you're a seriously loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?",Avengers: Infinity War
13475,PETER PARKER,"Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty....",Avengers: Infinity War
13476,TONY STARK,What the--,Avengers: Infinity War
13477,PETER PARKER,I know what you're gonna say.,Avengers: Infinity War
13478,TONY STARK,You should not be here.,Avengers: Infinity War
13479,PETER PARKER,I was gonna go home--,Avengers: Infinity War
13480,TONY STARK,I don't wanna hear it.,Avengers: Infinity War
13481,PETER PARKER,But it was such a long way down and I just thought about you on the way...,Avengers: Infinity War
13482,TONY STARK,And now I gotta hear it.,Avengers: Infinity War
13483,PETER PARKER,"...And I kinda stuck to the side of the ship. And this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way. So if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here.",Avengers: Infinity War
13484,TONY STARK,What did you just say?,Avengers: Infinity War
13485,PETER PARKER,I take that back. And now I'm here in space.,Avengers: Infinity War
13486,TONY STARK,Yeah.  Right where I don't want you to be. This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip. It's a one-way ticket. You hear me? Don't pretend like you thought this through. You could not have possibly thought this through.,Avengers: Infinity War
13487,PETER PARKER,No. I did think this through.,Avengers: Infinity War
13488,TONY STARK,You could not have possibly thought this through.,Avengers: Infinity War
13489,PETER PARKER,"It's just .. you can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man if there's no neighborhood.  Okay. That didn't really make any sense, but you know what I'm trying to say.",Avengers: Infinity War
13490,TONY STARK,Come on. We got a situation.  See him down there? He's in trouble. What's your plan? Go.,Avengers: Infinity War
13491,PETER PARKER,"Um. Okay, okay... uh...  Okay. Did you ever see this really old movie, Aliens?",Avengers: Infinity War
13492,EBONY MAW,Painful aren't they? They were originally designed for microsurgery. And any one of them... ...Could end your friend's life in an instant.,Avengers: Infinity War
13493,TONY STARK,"I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend. Saving his life is more a professional courtesy.",Avengers: Infinity War
13494,EBONY MAW,You've saved nothing. Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine.,Avengers: Infinity War
13495,TONY STARK,"Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.",Avengers: Infinity War
13496,PETER PARKER,"Yes! Wait what are those?! Hey, we haven't officially met.  Cool.",Avengers: Infinity War
13497,STEPHEN STRANGE,We've gotta turn this ship around.,Avengers: Infinity War
13498,TONY STARK,Yeah. Now he wants to run. Great plan.,Avengers: Infinity War
13499,STEPHEN STRANGE,"No, I want to protect the stone.",Avengers: Infinity War
13500,TONY STARK,"And I want you to thank me now. Go ahead, I'm listening.",Avengers: Infinity War
13501,STEPHEN STRANGE,For what? Nearly blasting me into space?,Avengers: Infinity War
13502,TONY STARK,Who just saved your magical ass? Me.,Avengers: Infinity War
13503,STEPHEN STRANGE,I seriously don't know how you fit your head into that helmet.,Avengers: Infinity War
13504,TONY STARK,Admit it. You should have ducked out when I told you to. I tried to bench you. You refused.,Avengers: Infinity War
13505,STEPHEN STRANGE,"Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you.",Avengers: Infinity War
13506,TONY STARK,"And due to that fact, we're now in a flying doughnut billions of miles away from Earth with no backup.",Avengers: Infinity War
13507,PETER PARKER,I'm backup.,Avengers: Infinity War
13508,TONY STARK,No. You're a stowaway.  The adults are talking.,Avengers: Infinity War
13509,STEPHEN STRANGE,"I'm sorry, I'm confused as to the relationship here. Wh-- what is he, your ward?",Avengers: Infinity War
13510,PETER PARKER,"No. I'm Peter, by the way.",Avengers: Infinity War
13511,STEPHEN STRANGE,Dr. Strange.,Avengers: Infinity War
13512,PETER PARKER,"Oh, we're using our made-up names. Um... I'm Spider-Man, then.",Avengers: Infinity War
13513,TONY STARK,This ship is self-correcting its course. Thing's on autopilot.,Avengers: Infinity War
13514,STEPHEN STRANGE,Can we control it? Fly us home?  Stark?,Avengers: Infinity War
13515,TONY STARK,Yeah?,Avengers: Infinity War
13516,STEPHEN STRANGE,Can you get us home?,Avengers: Infinity War
13517,TONY STARK,Yeah I heard you. I'm thinking... I'm not so sure we should.,Avengers: Infinity War
13518,STEPHEN STRANGE,Under no circumstance can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos. I don't think you quite understand what's at stake here.,Avengers: Infinity War
13519,TONY STARK,"No. It's you who doesn't understand, that Thanos has been inside my head for six years since he sent an army to New York and now he's back! And I don't know what to do. So I'm not so sure if it's a better plan to fight him on our turf or his but you saw what they did, what they can do. At least on his turf, he's not expecting it. So I say we take the fight to him. Doctor. Do you concur?",Avengers: Infinity War
13520,STEPHEN STRANGE,"Alright, Stark. We go to him. But you have to understand... if it comes to saving you or the kid or the Time Stone... I will not hesitate to let either of you die. I can't, because the fate of the universe depends on it.",Avengers: Infinity War
13521,TONY STARK,"Nice. Good. Moral compass. We're straight.  Alright, kid. You're an Avenger now.",Avengers: Infinity War
13522,THANOS,I thought you might be hungry.,Avengers: Infinity War
13523,GAMORA,I always hated that chair.,Avengers: Infinity War
13524,THANOS,So I've been told. Even so. I'd hoped you'd sit on it one day.,Avengers: Infinity War
13525,GAMORA,I hated this room. This ship. I hated my life.,Avengers: Infinity War
13526,THANOS,You told me that too.  Every day. For almost twenty years.,Avengers: Infinity War
13527,GAMORA,I was a child when you took me.,Avengers: Infinity War
13528,THANOS,I saved you.,Avengers: Infinity War
13529,GAMORA,No. No. We were happy on my home planet.,Avengers: Infinity War
13530,THANOS,"Going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I'm the one who stopped that. Do you know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise.",Avengers: Infinity War
13531,GAMORA,Because you murdered half the planet.,Avengers: Infinity War
13532,THANOS,A small price to pay for salvation.,Avengers: Infinity War
13533,GAMORA,You're insane.,Avengers: Infinity War
13534,THANOS,"Little one, it's a simple calculus. This universe is finite, its resources finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correction.",Avengers: Infinity War
13535,GAMORA,You don't know that!,Avengers: Infinity War
13536,THANOS,"I'm the only one who knows that. At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it.  For a time... you had that same will... as you fought by my side. Daughter.",Avengers: Infinity War
13537,GAMORA,I'm not your daughter. Everything I hate about myself you taught me.,Avengers: Infinity War
13538,THANOS,"And in doing so, made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy. That's why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone.",Avengers: Infinity War
13539,GAMORA,I'm sorry I disappointed you.,Avengers: Infinity War
13540,THANOS,I am disappointed. But not because you didn't find it.  But because you did.  And you lied.,Avengers: Infinity War
13541,GAMORA,Nebula. Don't do this.,Avengers: Infinity War
13542,THANOS,"Some time ago, your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me.",Avengers: Infinity War
13543,GAMORA,Please don't do this.,Avengers: Infinity War
13544,THANOS,And very nearly succeeded. So I brought her here. To talk.,Avengers: Infinity War
13545,GAMORA,Stop. Stop it.  I swear to you on my life. I never found the Soul Stone.,Avengers: Infinity War
13546,NEBULA,"You know what he's about to do. He's finally ready, and he's going for the stones. All of them.",Avengers: Infinity War
13547,GAMORA,He can never get them all.,Avengers: Infinity War
13548,NEBULA,He will!,Avengers: Infinity War
13549,GAMORA,"He can't, Nebula. Because I found the map to the Soul Stone and I burnt it to ash. I burnt it.",Avengers: Infinity War
13550,THANOS,You're strong. Me. You're generous. Me. But I never taught you to lie. That's why you're so bad at it.  Where is the Soul Stone?,Avengers: Infinity War
13551,GAMORA,Vormir!  The Stone is on Vormir.,Avengers: Infinity War
13552,THANOS,Show me.,Avengers: Infinity War
13553,GROOT,I am Groot.,Avengers: Infinity War
13554,ROCKET,Tinkle in the cup. We're not looking. What's there to see? What's a twig? Everybody's seen a twig.,Avengers: Infinity War
13555,GROOT,I am Groot.,Avengers: Infinity War
13556,THOR,"Tree, pour what's in the cup out in space, and go in the cup again.",Avengers: Infinity War
13557,ROCKET,You speak Groot?,Avengers: Infinity War
13558,THOR,"Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective.",Avengers: Infinity War
13559,GROOT,I am Groot.,Avengers: Infinity War
13560,THOR,You'll know when we're there. Nivadellir's forge harnesses the power of a blazing neutron star.  It's the birth place of my hammer. It's truly awesome.,Avengers: Infinity War
13561,ROCKET,"Okay, time to be the captain.  So, dead brother, huh? Yeah, that can be annoying.",Avengers: Infinity War
13562,THOR,"Well, he's been dead before, but this time I think it really might be true.",Avengers: Infinity War
13563,ROCKET,And you said your sister and your dad?,Avengers: Infinity War
13564,THOR,Both dead.,Avengers: Infinity War
13565,ROCKET,"Still got a mom, though?",Avengers: Infinity War
13566,THOR,Killed by a dark elf.,Avengers: Infinity War
13567,ROCKET,A best friend?,Avengers: Infinity War
13568,THOR,Stabbed through the heart.,Avengers: Infinity War
13569,ROCKET,Are you sure you're up to this particular murder mission?,Avengers: Infinity War
13570,THOR,"Absolutely. Rage, vengeance, anger, loss, regret... they're all tremendous motivators. They really clear the mind. So I'm good to go.",Avengers: Infinity War
13571,ROCKET,"Yeah, but this Thanos we're talking about... he's the toughest there is.",Avengers: Infinity War
13572,THOR,"Well, he's never fought me.",Avengers: Infinity War
13573,ROCKET,"Yeah, he has!",Avengers: Infinity War
13574,THOR,"He's never fought me twice. And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget.",Avengers: Infinity War
13575,ROCKET,Better be some hammer.,Avengers: Infinity War
13576,THOR,"You know, I'm 1,500 years old. I've killed twice as many enemies as that, and every one would have rather killed me, but none succeeded. I'm only alive because fate wants me alive. Thanos is the latest in a long line of bastards and he will be the latest to feel my vengeance. Fate wills it so.",Avengers: Infinity War
13577,ROCKET,And what if you're wrong?,Avengers: Infinity War
13578,THOR,If I'm wrong then... what more could I lose?,Avengers: Infinity War
13579,ROCKET,I could lose a lot. Me personally. I could lose a lot.  Okay. If fate does want you to kill that crapsack... you're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball.,Avengers: Infinity War
13580,THOR,What's this?,Avengers: Infinity War
13581,ROCKET,What's it look like? Some jerk lost a bet with me on on Contraxia.,Avengers: Infinity War
13582,THOR,He gave you his eye?,Avengers: Infinity War
13583,ROCKET,He gave me 100 credits. I snuck in later that night and stole his eye.,Avengers: Infinity War
13584,THOR,"Thank you, sweet rabbit.",Avengers: Infinity War
13585,ROCKET,"Hmm. Huh? Oh. I would've washed that. The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my... Hey, we're here!",Avengers: Infinity War
13586,THOR,I don't think this thing works. Everything seems dark.,Avengers: Infinity War
13587,ROCKET,It ain't the eye.,Avengers: Infinity War
13588,THOR,Something's wrong. The star's gone out. And the rings are frozen.,Avengers: Infinity War
13589,ROCKET,I hope these dwarves are better at forging than they are cleaning. Maybe they realized they live in a junk pile in the middle of space.,Avengers: Infinity War
13590,THOR,This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries....,Avengers: Infinity War
13591,ROCKET,"You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?",Avengers: Infinity War
13592,THOR,Yes. Why?,Avengers: Infinity War
13593,ROCKET,Look anything like that?,Avengers: Infinity War
13594,GROOT,I am Groot.,Avengers: Infinity War
13595,THOR,"Go back to the pod. Eitri, wait! Stop!",Avengers: Infinity War
13596,EITRI,Thor?,Avengers: Infinity War
13597,THOR,What happened here?,Avengers: Infinity War
13598,EITRI,You were supposed to protect us. Asgard was supposed to protect us!,Avengers: Infinity War
13599,THOR,"Asgard is destroyed.  Eitri, the glove. What did you do?",Avengers: Infinity War
13600,EITRI,"300 dwarves lived on this ring. I thought if I did what he asked, they'd be safe. I made what he wanted. A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones. Then he killed everyone anyway. All except me. 'Your life is yours,' he said. 'But your hands are mine alone.'",Avengers: Infinity War
13601,THOR,"Eitri, this isn't about your hands. Every weapon you've ever designed: every ax, hammer, sword - it's all inside your head. Now I know it feels like all hope is lost. Trust me, I know. But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos.",Avengers: Infinity War
13602,NEBULA,"Mantis, listen very carefully. I need you to meet me on Titan.",Avengers: Infinity War
13603,PETER PARKER,"Hey, what's going on?",Avengers: Infinity War
13604,STEPHEN STRANGE,I think we're here.,Avengers: Infinity War
13605,TONY STARK,I don't think this rig has a self-park function.  Get your hand into this steering gimbal. Close those around it. You understand?,Avengers: Infinity War
13606,PETER PARKER,"Yep, got it.",Avengers: Infinity War
13607,TONY STARK,"This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta to move at the same time.",Avengers: Infinity War
13608,PETER PARKER,Okay. Okay. Ready. We might wanna turn. Turn! Turn! Turn!!,Avengers: Infinity War
13609,TONY STARK,You alright?  That was close. I owe you one.,Avengers: Infinity War
13610,PETER PARKER,"Let me just say, if aliens wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something, and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.",Avengers: Infinity War
13611,TONY STARK,I don't wanna hear another single pop culture out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?,Avengers: Infinity War
13612,PETER PARKER,I'm trying to say that... something is coming.,Avengers: Infinity War
13613,DRAX,THANOS!!!!,Avengers: Infinity War
13614,PETER PARKER,AH! Whoawhoawhoawhoa! PLEASE DON'T PUT YOUR EGGS IN ME!,Avengers: Infinity War
13615,PETER QUILL,"Stay down, clown!",Avengers: Infinity War
13616,DRAX,"Die, blanket of death!",Avengers: Infinity War
13617,PETER QUILL,"Alright, everybody, stay where you are... chill the F out.  I'm gonna ask you this one time. Where's Gamora?",Avengers: Infinity War
13618,TONY STARK,"Yeah, I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?",Avengers: Infinity War
13619,DRAX,I'll do you one better. Why is Gamora?,Avengers: Infinity War
13620,PETER QUILL,"Tell me where the girl is, or I swear to you, I'm gonna French-fry this little freak.",Avengers: Infinity War
13621,TONY STARK,"Let's do it! You shoot my guy, I blast him. Let's go!",Avengers: Infinity War
13622,DRAX,"Do it, Quill! I can take it.",Avengers: Infinity War
13623,MANTIS,"No, he can't take it!",Avengers: Infinity War
13624,STEPHEN STRANGE,She's right. You can't.,Avengers: Infinity War
13625,PETER QUILL,Oh yeah? You don't wanna tell me where she is? That's fine. I'll kill all three of you and beat it out of Thanos myself.  Starting with you.,Avengers: Infinity War
13626,STEPHEN STRANGE,"Wait, what. Thanos?  Alright, let me ask you this one time: What master do you serve?",Avengers: Infinity War
13627,PETER QUILL,"What master do I serve? What am I supposed to say? ""Jesus""?",Avengers: Infinity War
13628,TONY STARK,You're from Earth?,Avengers: Infinity War
13629,PETER QUILL,I'm not from Earth. I'm from Missouri.,Avengers: Infinity War
13630,TONY STARK,"Yeah, that's on Earth, dip-shit. What are you hassling us for?",Avengers: Infinity War
13631,PETER PARKER,"So, you're not with Thanos?",Avengers: Infinity War
13632,PETER QUILL,"With Thanos?! No, I'm here to kill Thanos! He took my girl- Wai- who are you?",Avengers: Infinity War
13633,PETER PARKER,"We're the Avengers, man.",Avengers: Infinity War
13634,PETER QUILL,Oh.,Avengers: Infinity War
13635,MANTIS,You're the ones Thor told us about!,Avengers: Infinity War
13636,TONY STARK,You know Thor!?,Avengers: Infinity War
13637,PETER QUILL,"Yeah. Tall guy, not that good-looking,  needed saving.",Avengers: Infinity War
13638,STEPHEN STRANGE,Where is he now?,Avengers: Infinity War
13639,ROCKET,This is the plan? We're gonna hit him with a brick?,Avengers: Infinity War
13640,EITRI,"It's a mold. A king's weapon. Meant to be the greatest in Asgard. In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost.",Avengers: Infinity War
13641,THOR,Did it have a name?,Avengers: Infinity War
13642,EITRI,Stormbreaker.,Avengers: Infinity War
13643,ROCKET,That's a bit much.,Avengers: Infinity War
13644,THOR,So how do we make it?,Avengers: Infinity War
13645,EITRI,You'll have to restart the forge. Awaken the heart of a dying star.,Avengers: Infinity War
13646,THOR,"Rabbit, fire up the pod.",Avengers: Infinity War
13647,PETER QUILL,The heck happened to this planet? It's eight degrees off its axis. Gravitational pull is all over the place.,Avengers: Infinity War
13648,TONY STARK,"Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us. We'll use it. All right, I have a plan. Or at least the beginnings of one. It's pretty simple. We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need. Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy. We just want the gauntlet. Are you yawning? In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down? Huh? Did you hear what I said?",Avengers: Infinity War
13649,DRAX,"I stopped listening after you said, ""We need a plan.""",Avengers: Infinity War
13650,TONY STARK,"Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.",Avengers: Infinity War
13651,PETER QUILL,"See, ""not winging it"" isn't really what they do.",Avengers: Infinity War
13652,PETER PARKER,"Uh, what exactly is it that they do?",Avengers: Infinity War
13653,MANTIS,"Kick names, take ass.",Avengers: Infinity War
13654,DRAX,"Yeah, that's right.",Avengers: Infinity War
13655,TONY STARK,"Alright, just get over here, please. Mr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle up?",Avengers: Infinity War
13656,PETER QUILL,"""Mr. Lord."" Star-Lord is fine.",Avengers: Infinity War
13657,TONY STARK,We gotta coalesce. 'Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude....,Avengers: Infinity War
13658,PETER QUILL,"Dude, don't call us plucky. We don't know what it means. Alright, we're optimistic, yes. I like your plan. Except it sucks, so let me do the plan, and that way it might be really good.",Avengers: Infinity War
13659,DRAX,Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.,Avengers: Infinity War
13660,TONY STARK,What dance-off?,Avengers: Infinity War
13661,PETER QUILL,It's not a... it's not... it's nothing.,Avengers: Infinity War
13662,PETER PARKER,"Like in Footloose, the movie?",Avengers: Infinity War
13663,PETER QUILL,Exactly like Footloose. Is it still the greatest movie in history?,Avengers: Infinity War
13664,PETER PARKER,It never was.,Avengers: Infinity War
13665,TONY STARK,"Don't encourage this, alright?",Avengers: Infinity War
13666,PETER PARKER,Okay.,Avengers: Infinity War
13667,TONY STARK,We're getting no help from Flash Gordon here.,Avengers: Infinity War
13668,PETER QUILL,"Flash Gordon? By the way, that's a compliment. Don't forget, I'm half human.  So that 50% of me that's stupid? That's 100% you.",Avengers: Infinity War
13669,TONY STARK,Your math is blowing my mind.,Avengers: Infinity War
13670,MANTIS,"Excuse me, but... does your friend often do that?",Avengers: Infinity War
13671,TONY STARK,"Strange, we alright? You're back. You're alright.",Avengers: Infinity War
13672,PETER PARKER,"Hey, what was that?",Avengers: Infinity War
13673,STEPHEN STRANGE,I went forward in time to view alternate futures. To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict.,Avengers: Infinity War
13674,PETER QUILL,How many did you see?,Avengers: Infinity War
13675,STEPHEN STRANGE,"14,000,605",Avengers: Infinity War
13676,TONY STARK,How many did we win?,Avengers: Infinity War
13677,STEPHEN STRANGE,One.,Avengers: Infinity War
13678,THANOS,The stone had better be up there... for your sister's sake.,Avengers: Infinity War
13679,RED SKULL,"Welcome, Thanos, son of A'lars. Gamora, daughter of Thanos.",Avengers: Infinity War
13680,THANOS,You know us?,Avengers: Infinity War
13681,RED SKULL,It is my curse to know all who journey here.,Avengers: Infinity War
13682,THANOS,Where's the Soul Stone?,Avengers: Infinity War
13683,RED SKULL,You should know... it extracts a terrible price.,Avengers: Infinity War
13684,THANOS,I am prepared.,Avengers: Infinity War
13685,RED SKULL,We all think that at first.  We are all wrong.,Avengers: Infinity War
13686,THANOS,How is it you know this place so well?,Avengers: Infinity War
13687,RED SKULL,"A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones. I even held one in my hand. But it cast me out, banished me here. Guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess. What you seek lies before you. As does what you fear.",Avengers: Infinity War
13688,THANOS,What's this?,Avengers: Infinity War
13689,RED SKULL,The price. Soul hold a special place among the Infinity Stones. You might say it has a certain wisdom.,Avengers: Infinity War
13690,THANOS,Tell me what it needs.,Avengers: Infinity War
13691,RED SKULL,To ensure that whoever possesses it... understands its power.... The stone demands a sacrifice.,Avengers: Infinity War
13692,THANOS,Of what?,Avengers: Infinity War
13693,RED SKULL,"In order to take the stone, you must lose that which you love. A soul, for a soul.",Avengers: Infinity War
13694,GAMORA,"All my life, I dreamed of a day... a moment when you would get what you deserved. And I was always so disappointed. But now... you kill and torture... and you call it mercy. The universe has judged you. You asked it for a prize, and it told you no. You failed. And do you wanna know why? Because you love nothing. No one. Really? Tears?",Avengers: Infinity War
13695,RED SKULL,They're not for him.,Avengers: Infinity War
13696,GAMORA,No! This isn't love!,Avengers: Infinity War
13697,THANOS,"I ignored my destiny once. I cannot do that again. Even for you.  I'm sorry, little one.",Avengers: Infinity War

13701,OKOYE,When you said we were going to open Wakanda to the rest of the world... this is not what I imagined.,Avengers: Infinity War
13702,T'CHALLA,And what did you imagine?,Avengers: Infinity War
13703,OKOYE,The Olympics. Maybe even a Starbucks.,Avengers: Infinity War
13704,BRUCE BANNER,Should we bow?,Avengers: Infinity War
13705,JAMES RHODES,"Yeah, he's a king.",Avengers: Infinity War
13706,STEVE ROGERS,Seems like I'm always thanking you for something.,Avengers: Infinity War
13707,JAMES RHODES,What are you doing?,Avengers: Infinity War
13708,T'CHALLA,"Uh, we don't do that here.  So how big of an assault can we expect?",Avengers: Infinity War
13709,BRUCE BANNER,"Uh, sir, I think you can expect quite a big assault.",Avengers: Infinity War

13713,STEVE ROGERS,"How you been, Buck?",Avengers: Infinity War
13714,BUCKY BARNES,"Uh, not bad, for the end of the world.",Avengers: Infinity War
13715,SHURI,Whoa. The structure is polymorphic.,Avengers: Infinity War
13716,BRUCE BANNER,"Right, we had to attach each neuron non-sequentially.",Avengers: Infinity War
13717,SHURI,Why didn't you just reprogram the synapses to work collectively?,Avengers: Infinity War
13718,BRUCE BANNER,"Because, we didn't think of it.",Avengers: Infinity War
13719,SHURI,I'm sure you did your best.,Avengers: Infinity War
13720,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Can you do it?,Avengers: Infinity War
13721,SHURI,"Yes, but there are more than two trillion neurons here. One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures.  It will take time, brother.",Avengers: Infinity War
13722,STEVE ROGERS,How long?,Avengers: Infinity War
13723,SHURI,As long as you can give me.,Avengers: Infinity War
13724,OKOYE,Something's entered the atmosphere.,Avengers: Infinity War
13725,SAM WILSON,"Hey, Cap, we got a situation here.",Avengers: Infinity War
13726,BUCKY BARNES,"God, I love this place.",Avengers: Infinity War
13727,JAMES RHODES,"Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys. We got more incoming outside the dome.",Avengers: Infinity War
13728,VISION,It's too late. We need to destroy the stone now.,Avengers: Infinity War
13729,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Vision, get your ass back on the table.",Avengers: Infinity War

13732,WANDA MAXIMOFF,I will.,Avengers: Infinity War
13733,T'CHALLA,Evacuate the city. Engage all defense procedures.  And get this man a shield.,Avengers: Infinity War
13734,ROCKET,"I don't think you get the scientifics here. These rings are gigantic. You wanna get them moving, you're gonna need something a lot bigger to yank 'em loose.",Avengers: Infinity War
13735,THOR,Leave that to me.,Avengers: Infinity War
13736,ROCKET,"Leave that to you? Buddy, you're in space. All you got is a rope and a--",Avengers: Infinity War
13737,THOR,Fire the engines!,Avengers: Infinity War
13738,ROCKET,Nnnyah!,Avengers: Infinity War
13739,THOR,MORE... POWER... RABBIT!,Avengers: Infinity War

13744,EITRI,The mechanism is crippled.,Avengers: Infinity War
13745,THOR,What?,Avengers: Infinity War
13746,EITRI,With the iris closed I can't heat the metal.,Avengers: Infinity War
13747,THOR,How long will it take to heat?,Avengers: Infinity War
13748,EITRI,"A few minutes, maybe more. Why?",Avengers: Infinity War
13749,THOR,I'm gonna hold it open.,Avengers: Infinity War
13750,EITRI,That's suicide.,Avengers: Infinity War
13751,THOR,So is facing Thanos without that ax.,Avengers: Infinity War
13752,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"How we looking, Bruce?",Avengers: Infinity War
13753,BRUCE BANNER,"Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it. Wow! It's like being the Hulk without actually--  I'm okay. I'm okay.",Avengers: Infinity War
13754,JAMES RHODES,I got two heat signatures breaking through the tree line.,Avengers: Infinity War

13764,STEVE ROGERS,Not exactly.,Avengers: Infinity War

13766,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Looks like we pissed her off.,Avengers: Infinity War
13767,OKOYE,They're killing themselves.,Avengers: Infinity War
13768,SAM WILSON,You seen the teeth on those things?,Avengers: Infinity War
13769,JAMES RHODES,"Alright, back up, Sam. You're gonna get your wings singed.",Avengers: Infinity War
