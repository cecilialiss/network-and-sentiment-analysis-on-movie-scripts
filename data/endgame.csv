I don’t even know if you’re still...God, I hope so. Today’s day twenty-one, no...twenty- two. You know, if it wasn’t for the existential terror of staring into the literal void of space, I’d say I’m feeling a little better today. Infection’s run its course, thanks to the Blue Meanie back there. You’d like her.  She’s very practical.  And only a tiny bit sadistic.  The fuel cells were cracked during battle, but we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge.  Bought ourselves about 48 hours of flight time.  Problem is that was about...49 hours ago.  Which means, we’re dead in the water.  A thousand light years from the nearest 7-11. Most of the quote-unquote ‘food’ and potable water ran out two weeks ago. Pep, I know I said no more surprises.  But, I gotta say, I was really hoping to pull off one last one.  But it looks like...well, you know what it looks like. Don’t feel bad about this.  I mean, actually, if you grovel for a couple weeks, and then move on with enormous guilt...I should probably lie down for a minute, rest my eyes.  Please know, when I drift off, it will be like every day lately.  I’m fine, totally fine. I’m going to dream about you.  It’s always you. I couldn’t stop him.",Avengers: Endgame

14792,STEVE ROGERS,Wait...wait.  Scott.  Are you talking about a time machine?,Avengers: Endgame

14800,TONY STARK,You like going in the garage?  So does Daddy.  It’s all right.  Mommy never wears what I buy her. I just want to thank you folks for dropping by.  It’s not every day one gets to contemplate biting it on an inter-dimensional timescape.,Avengers: Endgame
14801,NATASHA ROMANOFF,You’ve got some objections to the plan.,Avengers: Endgame
14802,TONY STARK,"So you’re calling it a plan.  To me, it sounds like an exotic suicide method.  Not to mention, it’s impossible. ",Avengers: Endgame
14803,SCOTT LANG,We know what it sounds like.,Avengers: Endgame
14804,STEVE ROGERS,"Tony, after what you’ve seen, is anything really impossible? ",Avengers: Endgame

14814,STEVE ROGERS,I don’t believe we would.,Avengers: Endgame
14815,TONY STARK,"Gotta say it.  Sometimes I’ve missed that giddy optimism.  Sadly, all your high hopes won’t help me if there’s no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute said “time heist.”  I believe the most likely outcome would be our collective demise. ",Avengers: Endgame
14816,SCOTT LANG,Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel.  No talking to our past selves.  No betting on sporting events-,Avengers: Endgame

14818,SCOTT LANG,No...,Avengers: Endgame
14819,TONY STARK,"Good.  Because that would be horseshit.  Scientifically speaking, your brother’s picture doesn’t disappear just ‘cause you went to the dance with your mom. That’s not how quantum physics works. ",Avengers: Endgame

14841,BRUCE BANNER,"Five years ago, we got our asses kicked, right?",Avengers: Endgame
14842,STEVE ROGERS,He’s heard.,Avengers: Endgame
14843,BRUCE BANNER,It was worse for me.  Because I lost twice.  First Hulk lost.  Then Banner lost.  Then we all lost.,Avengers: Endgame
14844,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"No one blamed you, Bruce. ",Avengers: Endgame
14845,BRUCE BANNER,"I did-  I feel like I’m the only one eating.  Here, try some. Thing is, I kept thinking, it didn’t have to be that way.  That the best of Banner and best of Hulk, if they’d worked together, maybe they could’ve stopped Thanos. ",Avengers: Endgame
14846,SCOTT LANG,Okay.  But how did...this happen?,Avengers: Endgame
14847,BRUCE BANNER,"For years I treated the Hulk like a disease, something to get rid of. But when I started treating him like the cure... Eighteen months in the Gamma Lab. I put the brains and the brawn together.  And now look at me. Best of both worlds.",Avengers: Endgame

14882,TONY STARK,Yeah.,Avengers: Endgame
14883,PEPPER POTTS,And terrifying.,Avengers: Endgame
14884,TONY STARK,To say the least.,Avengers: Endgame
14885,PEPPER POTTS,We got really lucky-,Avengers: Endgame
14886,TONY STARK,I know-,Avengers: Endgame

14889,PEPPER POTTS,"Except, it sort of seems like you can. ",Avengers: Endgame
14890,TONY STARK,Not if I stopped right here.,Avengers: Endgame
14891,PEPPER POTTS,"Tony, trying to get you to stop is one of the few failures of my life. ",Avengers: Endgame
14892,TONY STARK,"I could just lock the lab, put it in a trunk, sink it to the bottom of the lake, and go to bed. ",Avengers: Endgame
14893,PEPPER POTTS,But could you rest?,Avengers: Endgame
14894,SCOTT LANG,You’re sure these modifications are safe?,Avengers: Endgame

14904,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"You were kidding, right? ",Avengers: Endgame
14905,BRUCE BANNER,"Honestly, I have no idea.  We’re attempting time travel.  Either it’s all a joke, or none of it is. We’re good!  Helmet on.  Okay.  I’m going to send you back one week, give you an hour to look around, then bring you back in ten seconds.  Make sense? ",Avengers: Endgame

14920,STEVE ROGERS,As a baby! ,Avengers: Endgame
14921,BRUCE BANNER,"When I tell you, kill the power! Now! ",Avengers: Endgame
14922,SCOTT LANG,Somebody peed my pants.  I don’t know if it was baby-me or old-me. Or just me-me.,Avengers: Endgame
14923,TONY STARK,"Why the long face?  Wild guess, he turned into a baby? ",Avengers: Endgame
14924,STEVE ROGERS,Among other things.,Avengers: Endgame
14925,TONY STARK,"EPR Paradox.  Instead of pushing Lang through time, you were pushing time through Lang.  It’s dangerous. I probably should’ve cautioned you against it. ",Avengers: Endgame
14926,STEVE ROGERS,You did.,Avengers: Endgame
14927,TONY STARK,"Thank god, I’m here.  Regardless, I fixed it.  That is a fully-functioning, time- space GPS.  I just want peace. Resentment is corrosive.  I hate it. ",Avengers: Endgame
14928,STEVE ROGERS,"Me, too.",Avengers: Endgame
14929,TONY STARK,"We’ve got a shot at the Stones.  I just need you to know my priorities.  Bring back everyone we lost, hopefully.  Keep what I found, definitely.  And, let’s not die trying.",Avengers: Endgame

14932,STEVE ROGERS,"Tony, I don’t know- ",Avengers: Endgame

15023,BRUCE BANNER,"Uh, one, because that’s horrible. And, two, killing baby Thanos doesn’t kill adult Thanos.  Time doesn’t work like that.  You can’t change the future by changing the past. ",Avengers: Endgame

15051,ROCKET,Quill said he stole the Power Stone from Morag.,Avengers: Endgame

But today we have a chance to take it all back. You have your teams and you have assignments.  Get your stone, and get back here.  One round trip each.  No mistakes.  No do-overs. Most of us are going back to places we know.  That doesn’t mean we know what to expect.  Be careful.  Look out for each other.  Improvise, if you have to. This is the fight of our lives.

There are plenty of people who are only kind of gone.  And you can help them.  So, is it too much to ask that you brush the crumbs out of your beard, make shmoopy talk to Prettypants, and when she’s not looking, suck out the Infinity Stone, and help me get my family back?

15413,TONY STARK,Yeah.  I guess.,Avengers: Endgame
15414,HOWARD STARK,Let me ask you a question.  When your kid was born...were you nervous?,Avengers: Endgame
15415,TONY STARK,Wildly.,Avengers: Endgame
15416,HOWARD STARK,Did you feel qualified?  Like you had any idea how to successfully operate that thing?,Avengers: Endgame
15417,TONY STARK,I pieced it together as I went along.  I thought about what my dad did...,Avengers: Endgame
15418,HOWARD STARK,My old man never met a problem he couldn’t solve with a belt.,Avengers: Endgame

15423,TONY STARK,He did his best.,Avengers: Endgame
15424,HOWARD STARK,"I tell you, this kid’s not even here yet, but there’s nothing I wouldn’t do for him. Besides, if I fall down on the fathering job, old Jarvis is ready to pick up the slack.  Isn’t that right? ",Avengers: Endgame

15435,BAD NEBULA,Shut up!,Avengers: Endgame
15436,NEBULA,You could stop this.  You know you want to. Did you see what happens in the future?  Thanos finds the Soul Stone. You want to know how he does that? You want to know what he does to you-,Avengers: Endgame
15437,BAD NEBULA,ENOUGH! You disgust me...but that doesn’t mean you’re useless. How do I look?,Avengers: Endgame

15452,CLINT BARTON,Maybe he’s full of shit.,Avengers: Endgame
15453,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I don’t think so.,Avengers: Endgame
15454,CLINT BARTON,"Why, because he knew your daddy’s name? ",Avengers: Endgame
15455,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I didn’t. Thanos left here with the stone, and without his daughter.  You really think that’s a coincidence? Whatever it takes...",Avengers: Endgame
15456,CLINT BARTON,Whatever it takes...,Avengers: Endgame
15457,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"If we don’t get the stone, billions of people are going to stay dead. ",Avengers: Endgame

15484,CLINT BARTON,We can’t get her back.,Avengers: Endgame
15485,THOR,"What’s he talking about?  Of course, we can. ",Avengers: Endgame
15486,CLINT BARTON,It can’t be undone.  That’s why.,Avengers: Endgame
15487,THOR,"No offense, but you’re...a very earthly being.  We’re talking about space magic, here.  “Can’t” seems a little definitive, don’t you think? ",Avengers: Endgame
15488,CLINT BARTON,"Well, I know I’m a little outside my pay grade here, but, she still isn’t here, is she? ",Avengers: Endgame
15489,THOR,That’s my point-,Avengers: Endgame
15490,CLINT BARTON,"It can’t be undone.  At least that’s what the red, floating guy said.  But why don’t you go talk to him, okay?  Why don’t you grab your hammer and fly to that place and talk to him.  IT CAN’T BE UNDONE. It was supposed to be me.  She sacrificed her life for that goddamn stone.  She bet her life on it.",Avengers: Endgame

15492,STEVE ROGERS,We will.,Avengers: Endgame

15496,STEVE ROGERS,"Thor, we haven’t decided who’s putting that on. ",Avengers: Endgame
15497,THOR,Oh.  Were all of you just waiting for the right opportunity?,Avengers: Endgame
15498,ROCKET,Maybe I was getting around to it-,Avengers: Endgame
15499,SCOTT LANG,We should at least discuss it-,Avengers: Endgame

15550,TONY STARK,Don’t think I care.,Avengers: Endgame
15551,THOR,Just so we’re all in agreement. Let’s kill him properly this time.,Avengers: Endgame
15552,THANOS,"You could not live with your own failure.  And where did that bring you?  Right back to me. I thought by eliminating half of life, the other half would thrive.

They will resist. ",Avengers: Endgame

If you’d told me ten years ago that we weren’t alone, let alone to this extent, I probably wouldn’t have been surprised.  But come on... Who knew what epic forces of dark and light would come into play? For better or worse, that’s the reality our children get to grow up in. That’s why I thought I’d probably better record a little greeting, in the case of…an untimely death on my part.  I mean, death at any time is untimely, but...this “time travel” thing we’re going to try to pull off tomorrow has me scratching my head about the “survivability” of it all.
