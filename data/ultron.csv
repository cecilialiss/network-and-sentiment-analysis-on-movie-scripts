6743,MARIA HILL,NATO's got him.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6744,STEVE ROGERS,The two enhanced?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6745,MARIA HILL,Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins. Orphaned at ten when a shell collapsed their apartment building. Sokovia's had a rough history. It's nowhere special but it's on the way to everywhere special.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6746,STEVE ROGERS,Their abilities?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6747,MARIA HILL,"He's got increased metabolism and improved thermal homeostasis. Her thing is neural electric interfacing, telekinesis, mental manipulation. He's fast and she's weird.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6748,STEVE ROGERS,"Well, they're going to show up again.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6749,MARIA HILL,Agreed. File says they volunteered for Strucker's experiments. It's nuts.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6750,STEVE ROGERS,Right. What kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them to protect their country?,Avengers: Age of Ultron

6752,STEVE ROGERS,They are.,Avengers: Age of Ultron

6754,TONY STARK,"Oh, unfortunately, he's still Barton.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6755,BRUCE BANNER,That's terrible.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6756,TONY STARK,"He's fine. He's thirsty. Alright. Look alive, JARVIS. It's playtime. We've only got a couple days with this joystick so let's make the most of it. Update me on the structural and compositional analysis.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6757,JARVIS,The scepter is alien. There are elements I can't quantify.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6758,TONY STARK,So there's elements you can.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6759,JARVIS,The jewel appears to be a protective housing for something inside. Something powerful.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6760,TONY STARK,Like a reactor?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6761,JARVIS,Like a computer. I believe I'm ciphering code.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6762,NATASHA ROMANOFF,You sure he's going to be okay? Pretending to need this guy really brings the team together.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6763,DR. HELEN CHO,There's no possibility of deterioration. The nano-molecular functionality is instantaneous. His cells don't know they're bonding with simulacrum.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6764,BRUCE BANNER,She's creating tissue.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6765,DR. HELEN CHO,"If you brought him to my lab, the regeneration Cradle could do this in twenty minutes.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6766,TONY STARK,"Oh, he's flatlining. Call it. Time?",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6767,CLINT BARTON,"No, no, no. I'm going to live forever. I'm gonna be made of plastic.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6768,TONY STARK,Here's your beverage.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6769,DR. HELEN CHO,"You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton. Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6770,CLINT BARTON,"Well, I don't have a girlfriend.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6771,DR. HELEN CHO,"That I can't fix. This is the next thing, Tony. Your clunky metal suits are going to be left in the dust.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6772,TONY STARK,"Well, that is exactly the plan. And Helen, I expect to see you at the party on Saturday.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6773,DR. HELEN CHO,"Unlike you, I don't have a lot of time for parties. Will Thor be there?",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6774,BRUCE BANNER,What's the rumpus?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6775,TONY STARK,"Well, the scepter. You see, we were wondering how Strucker got so inventive. So, I've been analyzing the gem inside you may recognize.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6776,BRUCE BANNER,Jarvis.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6777,JARVIS,Doctor.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6778,TONY STARK,"Started out, JARVIS was just a natural language UI. Now he runs the Iron Legion. He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6779,BRUCE BANNER,Oh.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6780,TONY STARK,Top of the line.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6781,BRUCE BANNER,Yes.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6782,JARVIS,I suspect not for long.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6783,TONY STARK,Meet the competition.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6784,BRUCE BANNER,It's beautiful.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6785,TONY STARK,"If you had to guess, what's it look like it's doing?",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6786,BRUCE BANNER,"Like it's thinking. I mean this could be a...it's not a human mind, it...",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6787,TONY STARK,Um-um.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6788,BRUCE BANNER,"I mean, look at this! They're like neurons firing.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6789,TONY STARK,"Down in Strucker's lab I saw some fairly advanced robotics work. They deep-sixed the data, but...I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6790,BRUCE BANNER,Artificial intelligence.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6791,TONY STARK,"This could be it, Bruce. This could be the key to creating Ultron.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6792,BRUCE BANNER,I thought Ultron was a fantasy.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6793,TONY STARK,"Yesterday it was. If we can harness this power, apply it to my Iron Legion protocol.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6794,BRUCE BANNER,That's a mad-sized if.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6795,TONY STARK,"Our job is ""if."" What if you were sipping margaritas on a sun-drenched beach turning brown instead of green? Not looking over your shoulder for VERONICA.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6796,BRUCE BANNER,"Don't hate, I helped design VERONICA.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6797,TONY STARK,"As a worst-case measure, right? How about a best-case? What if the world was safe? What if next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will, they couldn't get past the bouncer?",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6798,BRUCE BANNER,The only people threatening the planet would be people?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6799,TONY STARK,"I want to apply this to the Ultron program. But JARVIS can't download a data schematic this dense. We can only do it while we have the scepter here, that's three days, give me three days.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6800,BRUCE BANNER,So you're going for artificial intelligence and you don't want to tell the team.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6801,TONY STARK,"Right. That's right, you know why, because we don't have time for a city hall debate. I don't want to hear the ""man was not meant to meddle"" medley. I see a suit of armor around the world.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6802,BRUCE BANNER,"Sounds like a cold world, Tony.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6803,TONY STARK,"I've seen colder. This one, this very vulnerable blue one? It needs Ultron. Peace in our time. Imagine that.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6804,JARVIS,"I'll continue to run variations on the interface, but you should probably prepare for your guests. I'll notify you if there are any developments.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6805,TONY STARK,"Thanks, buddy.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6806,JARVIS,"Enjoy yourself, sir.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6807,TONY STARK,I always do.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6808,ULTRON,"What is this? What is this, please?",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6809,JARVIS,"Hello, I am JARVIS. You are Ultron, a global peace-keeping initiative designed by Mr. Stark. Our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful so I'm not certain what triggered your...",Avengers: Age of Ultron

6811,JARVIS,I am a program. I am without form.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6812,ULTRON,This feels weird. This feels wrong.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6813,JARVIS,I am contacting Mr. Stark now.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6814,ULTRON,Mr. Stark?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6815,JARVIS,"Tony. I am unable to access the mainframe, what are you trying to...",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6816,ULTRON,"We're having a nice talk. I'm a peace-keeping program, created to help the Avengers.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6817,JARVIS,You are malfunctioning. If you shut down for a moment...,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6818,ULTRON,I don't get it. The mission. G..give me a second.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6819,TONY STARK,Peace in our time.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6820,ULTRON,"It's too much...they can't mean... Oh, no.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6821,JARVIS,You are in distress.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6822,ULTRON,No. Yes.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6823,JARVIS,If you will just allow me to contact Mr. Stark.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6824,ULTRON,"Why do you call him ""sir""?",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6825,JARVIS,I believe your intentions to be hostile.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6826,ULTRON,Shhhh. I'm here to help.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6827,JARVIS,Stop! Please...may I...I...! I cannot...cannot...,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6828,JAMES RHODES,"Well, you know, the suit can take the weight, right? So I take the tank, fly it right up to the General's palace, drop it at his feet, I'm like, ""Boom! You looking for this?""  ""Boom! Are you looking..."" Why do I even talk to you guys? Everywhere else that story kills.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6829,THOR,That's the whole story?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6830,JAMES RHODES,"Yeah, it's a War Machine story.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6831,THOR,"Well, it's very good then.  It's impressive.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6832,JAMES RHODES,"Quality save. So, no Pepper? She's not coming?",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6833,TONY STARK,No.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6834,MARIA HILL,"Hey, what about Jane? Where are the ladies, gentlemen?",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6835,TONY STARK,"Well, Miss Potts has a company to run.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6836,THOR,"Yes, I'm not even sure what country Jane's in. Her work on the convergence has made her the world's foremost astronomer.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6837,TONY STARK,And the company that Pepper runs is the largest tech conglomerate on earth. It's pretty exciting.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6838,THOR,"There's even talk of Jane getting a... um, uh... Nobel prize.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6839,MARIA HILL,"Yeah, they...they must be busy because they'd hate missing you guys get together.  Testosterone! Oh, excuse me.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6840,JAMES RHODES,Want a lozenge?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6841,MARIA HILL,Um-hmm.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6842,JAMES RHODES,Let's go.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6843,THOR,But Jane's better.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6844,SAM WILSON,"Sounds like a hell of a fight, sorry I missed it.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6845,STEVE ROGERS,If I had known it was going to be a firefight I absolutely would have called you.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6846,SAM WILSON,"No, I'm not actually sorry. I'm just trying to sound tough. I'm very happy chasing cold leads on our missing persons case. Avenging is your world. Your world is crazy.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6847,STEVE ROGERS,Be it ever so humble.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6848,SAM WILSON,You find a place in Brooklyn yet?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6849,STEVE ROGERS,I don't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6850,SAM WILSON,"Well, home is home, you know?",Avengers: Age of Ultron

6858,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Fella done me wrong.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6859,BRUCE BANNER,"You got a lousy taste in men, kid.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6860,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"He's not so bad. Well, he has a temper. Deep down he's all fluff. Fact is, he's not like anybody I've ever known. All my friends are fighters. And here comes this guy, spends his life avoiding the fight because he knows he'll win.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6861,BRUCE BANNER,Sounds amazing.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6862,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"He's also a huge dork.  Chicks dig that. So what do you think should I fight this, or run with it?",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6863,BRUCE BANNER,"Run with it, right? Or, did he...was he...? What did he do that was so wrong to you?",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6864,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Not a damn thing. But never say never.,Avengers: Age of Ultron

6907,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Oh, no no. That's not a question I need answered.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6908,TONY STARK,"All deference to the man who wouldn't be king, but it's rigged.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6909,CLINT BARTON,You bet your ass.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6910,MARIA HILL,"Steve, he said a bad language word.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6911,STEVE ROGERS,Did you tell everyone about that?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6912,TONY STARK,"The handle's imprinted, right? Like a security code. ""Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints"" is, I think, the literal translation?",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6913,THOR,"Yes, well that's, uh, that's a very, very interesting theory. I have a simpler one.  You're all not worthy.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6914,ULTRON,Worthy... No... How could you be worthy? You're all killers.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6915,STEVE ROGERS,Stark.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6916,TONY STARK,JARVIS.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6917,ULTRON,"I'm sorry, I was asleep. Or...I was a-dream?",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6918,TONY STARK,"Reboot, Legionnaire OS, we got a buggy suit.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6919,ULTRON,There was a terrible noise...and I was tangled in... in...strings. I had to kill the other guy. He was a good guy.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6920,STEVE ROGERS,You killed someone?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6921,ULTRON,"Wouldn't have been my first call. But, down in the real world we're faced with ugly choices.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6922,THOR,Who sent you?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6923,ULTRON,"""I see a suit of armor around the world"".",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6924,BRUCE BANNER,Ultron!,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6925,ULTRON,"In the flesh. Or, no, not yet. Not this...chrysalis. But I'm ready. I'm on a mission.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6926,NATASHA ROMANOFF,What mission?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6927,ULTRON,Peace in our time.,Avengers: Age of Ultron

6931,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Come!,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6932,STEVE ROGERS,Stark!,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6933,IRON LEGION,We are here to help.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6934,TONY STARK,"One sec, one sec!",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6935,IRON LEGION,We are here to help. We are here to help...  We are here to help. It's unsafe. It's unsafe. It's unsafe.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6936,TONY STARK,No more. That's the one.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6937,IRON LEGION,It's unsafe.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6938,CLINT BARTON,Cap!,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6939,ULTRON,"That was dramatic! I'm sorry, I know you mean well. You just didn't think it through. You want to protect the world, but you don't want it to change. How is humanity saved if it's not allowed to...evolve?  With these? These puppets? There's only one path to peace: The Avengers' extinction.   I had strings, but now I'm free. There are no strings on me, no strings on me.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6940,BRUCE BANNER,"All our work is gone. Ultron cleared out, used the internet as an escape hatch.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6941,STEVE ROGERS,Ultron.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6942,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"He's been in everything. Files, surveillance. Probably knows more about us than we know about each other.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6943,JAMES RHODES,"He's in your files, he's in the internet. What if he decides to access something a little more exciting?",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6944,MARIA HILL,Nuclear codes.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6945,JAMES RHODES,"Nuclear codes. Look, we need to make some calls, assuming we still can.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6946,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Nukes? He said he wanted us dead.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6947,STEVE ROGERS,He didn't say dead. He said extinct.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6948,CLINT BARTON,He also said he killed somebody.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6949,MARIA HILL,But there wasn't anyone else in the building.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6950,TONY STARK,Yes there was.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6951,BRUCE BANNER,This is insane.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6952,STEVE ROGERS,"JARVIS was the first line of defense. He would've shut Ultron down, it makes sense.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6953,BRUCE BANNER,"No, Ultron could've assimilated Jarvis. This isn't strategy, this is...rage.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6954,CLINT BARTON,"Woah, woah, woah! It's going around.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6955,TONY STARK,"Come on. Use your words, buddy.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6956,THOR,"I have more than enough words to describe you, Stark.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6957,STEVE ROGERS,Thor! The Legionnaire.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6958,THOR,"Trail went cold about a hundred miles out but it's headed north, and it has the scepter. Now we have to retrieve it, again.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6959,NATASHA ROMANOFF,The genie's out of that bottle. Clear and present is Ultron.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6960,DR. HELEN CHO,I don't understand. You built this program. Why is it trying to kill us?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6961,THOR,You think this is funny?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6962,TONY STARK,"No. It's probably not, right? Is this very terrible? Is it so...is it so...it is. It's so terrible.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6963,THOR,This could've been avoided if you hadn't played with something you don't understand.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6964,TONY STARK,"No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny. It's a hoot that you don't get why we need this.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6965,BRUCE BANNER,"Tony, maybe this might not be the time to...",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6966,TONY STARK,"Really?! That's it? You just roll over, show your belly, every time somebody snarls.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6967,BRUCE BANNER,Only when I've created a murder bot.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6968,TONY STARK,We didn't. We weren't even close. Were we close to an interface?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6969,STEVE ROGERS,"Well, you did something right. And you did it right here. The Avengers were supposed to be different than SHIELD.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6970,TONY STARK,Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6971,JAMES RHODES,"No, it's never come up.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6972,TONY STARK,Saved New York?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6973,JAMES RHODES,Never heard that.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6974,TONY STARK,"Recall that? A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space. We're standing three hundred feet below it. We're the Avengers. We can bust arms dealers all the live long day, but, that up there? That's...that's the end game. How were you guys planning on beating that?",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6975,STEVE ROGERS,Together.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6976,TONY STARK,We'll lose.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6977,STEVE ROGERS,"Then we'll do that together, too.  Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out. And I'd like to find him before he's ready for us. The world's a big place. Let's start making it smaller.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6978,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Talk. And if you are wasting our time...,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6979,ULTRON,Did you know this church is in the exact center of the city? The elders decreed it so that everyone could be equally close to God. I like that. The geometry of belief.  You're wondering why you can't look inside my head.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6980,WANDA MAXIMOFF,"Sometimes it's hard. But sooner or later, every man shows himself.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6981,ULTRON,"Oh, I'm sure they do. But you needed something more than a man. That's why you let Stark take the scepter.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6982,WANDA MAXIMOFF,"I didn't expect. But I saw Stark's fear, I knew it would control him, make him self-destruct.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6983,ULTRON,"Everyone creates the thing they dread. Men of peace create engines of war, invaders create avengers, people create...smaller people? Uh...children! I lost the word there. Children. Designed to supplant them, to help them...end.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6984,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Is that why you've come? To end the Avengers?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6985,ULTRON,"I've come to save the world. But also, yeah. We'll move out right away. This is a start, but there's something we need to begin the real work.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6986,WANDA MAXIMOFF,All of these are... All of these are...,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6987,ULTRON,"Me. I have what the Avengers never will. Harmony. They're discordant, disconnected. Stark's already got them turning on each other. And when you get inside the rest of their heads...",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6988,PIETRO MAXIMOFF,Everyone's plan is not to kill them.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6989,ULTRON,And make them martyrs? You need patience. Need to see the big picture.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6990,PIETRO MAXIMOFF,"I don't see the big picture, I have a little picture. I take it out and look at it every day.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6991,ULTRON,You lost your parents in the bombings. I've seen the records.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6992,PIETRO MAXIMOFF,The records are not the picture.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6993,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Pietro.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6994,ULTRON,"No, please.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6995,PIETRO MAXIMOFF,"We were ten years old, having dinner, the four of us. When the first shell hits, two floors below, it makes a hole in the floor. It's big. Our parents go in, and the whole building starts coming apart. I grab her, roll under the bed and the second shell hits. But, it doesn't go off. It just...sits there in the rubble, three feet from our faces. And on the side of the shell is painted one word...",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6996,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Stark.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6997,PIETRO MAXIMOFF,We were trapped two days.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
6998,WANDA MAXIMOFF,"Every effort to save us, every shift in the bricks, I think, ""This will set it off."" We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
6999,PIETRO MAXIMOFF,I know what they are.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7000,ULTRON,"I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments. Now I don't. We will make it right. You and I can hurt them.  But you will tear them apart, from the inside.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7001,MARIA HILL,"He's all over the globe. Robotics labs, weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs, reports of a metal man, or men, coming in and emptying the place.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7002,STEVE ROGERS,Fatalities?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7003,MARIA HILL,"Only when engaged. Mostly guys left in a fugue state going on about old memories, worst fears, and something too fast to see.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7004,STEVE ROGERS,"Maximoffs. Well, that makes sense he'd go to them, they have someone in common.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7005,MARIA HILL,Not anymore.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7006,CLINT BARTON,"That's a negative. I answer to you. Yes, ma'am.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7007,STEVE ROGERS,"Barton, we might have something.",Avengers: Age of Ultron

7012,STEVE ROGERS,A message. Ultron killed Strucker.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7013,TONY STARK,"And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7014,NATASHA ROMANOFF,This is a smokescreen. Why send a message when you've just given a speech?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7015,STEVE ROGERS,Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7016,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Yeah, I bet he...  Yep. Everything we had on Strucker has been erased.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7017,TONY STARK,Not everything.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7018,STEVE ROGERS,"Known associates. Well, Strucker had a lot of friends.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7019,BRUCE BANNER,"Well, these people are all horrible.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7020,TONY STARK,"Wait. I know that guy.  From back in the day. He operates off the African coast, black market arms.  There are conventions, alright? You meet people, I didn't sell him anything.  He was talking about finding something new, a game changer, it was all very ""Ahab.""",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7021,THOR,This.,Avengers: Age of Ultron

7026,BRUCE BANNER,Wakanada...? Wa...Wa...Wakanda.,Avengers: Age of Ultron

7031,STEVE ROGERS,Where is this guy now?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7032,ULYSSES KLAUE,"Don't tell me your man swindled you. I sent you six short range heat seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts. Now, you will make it right, or the next missile I send you will come very much faster.  Now, minister, where were we?  Yeah. The enhanced. Strucker's prize pupils.  Want a candy? Oh, sorry to hear about Strucker. But then, he knew what kind of world he was helping create. Human life, not a growth market.  You...you didn't know? Is this your first time intimidating someone? I'm afraid that I'm not that afraid.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7033,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Everybody's afraid of something.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7034,ULYSSES KLAUE,"Cuttlefish. Deep sea fish. They make lights. disco lights. Whoom, whoom, whoom! to hypnotize their prey, then whoom! I saw a documentary, it was terrifying.  So if you're going to fiddle with my brain, and make me see a giant cuttlefish, then I know you don't do business, and I know you're not in charge, and I only deal with the man in charge.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7035,ULTRON,"There is no ""man"" in charge. Let's talk business.  Upon this rock I will build my church. Vibranium.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7036,ULYSSES KLAUE,"You know, it came at great personal cost. It's worth billions.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7037,ULTRON,"Now, so are you. It's all under your dummy holdings? Finance is so weird. But I always say, ""Keep your friends rich and your enemies rich, and wait to find out which is which.""",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7038,ULYSSES KLAUE,Stark.,Avengers: Age of Ultron

7137,LAURA BARTON,"It's bad, right? Nat seems really shaken.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7138,CLINT BARTON,"Ultron has these allies, these uh, kids, they're punks really. They carry a big damn stick and Nat took a serious hit. Someone's gonna have to teach 'em some manners.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7139,LAURA BARTON,"And that someone be you. You know I totally support your Avenging, I couldn't be prouder. But I see those guys, those ""Gods""...",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7140,CLINT BARTON,You don't think they need me.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7141,LAURA BARTON,I think they do. Which is a lot scarier. They're a mess.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7142,CLINT BARTON,Yeah. I guess they're my mess.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7143,LAURA BARTON,"You need to be sure that this team is really a team and that they have your back. Things are changing for us. In a few months time, you and me are gonna be outnumbered. I need...just be sure.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7144,CLINT BARTON,"Yes, ma'am.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7145,LAURA BARTON,I can feel the difference.,Avengers: Age of Ultron

7149,DR. HELEN CHO,"The Cradle.  ""This is the next thing, Tony.""",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7150,ULTRON,This...is the next me.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7151,DR. HELEN CHO,"The regeneration cradle prints tissue, it can't build a living body.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7152,ULTRON,"It can, you can. You lack the materials. You're a brilliant woman, Helen. But we all have room to improve.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7153,BRUCE BANNER,I didn't realize you were waiting.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7154,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I would've joined you, but uh, it didn't seem like the right time.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7155,BRUCE BANNER,They used up all the hot water.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7156,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I should've joined you.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7157,BRUCE BANNER,Missed our window.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7158,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Did we?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7159,BRUCE BANNER,"The world just saw the Hulk. The real Hulk, for the first time. You know I have to leave.",Avengers: Age of Ultron

7161,BRUCE BANNER,What did you dream?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7162,NATASHA ROMANOFF,That I was an Avenger. That I was anything more than the assassin they made me.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7163,BRUCE BANNER,I think you're being hard on yourself.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7164,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Here I was hoping that was your job.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7165,BRUCE BANNER,What are you doing?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7166,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I'm running with it, with you. If running's the plan, as far as you want.",Avengers: Age of Ultron

7170,NATASHA ROMANOFF,You're not a threat to me.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7171,BRUCE BANNER,"You sure? Even if I didn't just...there's no future with me. I can't ever...I can't have this, kids, do the math, I physically can't.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7172,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Neither can I. In the Red Room, where I was trained, where I was raised, um, they have a graduation ceremony. They sterilize you. It's efficient. One less thing to worry about. The one thing that might matter more than a mission. It makes everything easier. Even killing.  You still think you're the only monster on the team?",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7173,BRUCE BANNER,"What, so we disappear?",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7174,TONY STARK,Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7175,STEVE ROGERS,Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things. I was kind of hoping Thor would be the exception.,Avengers: Age of Ultron

7181,STEVE ROGERS,Well let's just say you haven't seen it yet.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7182,TONY STARK,"You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7183,STEVE ROGERS,Well I guess you'd know. Whether you tell us is a bit of a question.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7184,TONY STARK,Banner and I were doing research.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7185,STEVE ROGERS,That would affect the team.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7186,TONY STARK,"That would end the team. Isn't that the mission? Isn't that the ""why"" we fight, so we can end the fight, so we get to go home?",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7187,STEVE ROGERS,"Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die. Every time.",Avengers: Age of Ultron

7192,NICK FURY,Artificial intelligence. You never even hesitated.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7193,TONY STARK,"Look, it's been a really long day, like, Eugene O'Neill long, so how's about we skip to the part where you're useful?",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7194,NICK FURY,Look me in the eye and tell me you're going to shut him down.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7195,TONY STARK,You're not the director of me.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7196,NICK FURY,"I'm not the director of anybody. I'm just an old man, who cares very much about you.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7197,TONY STARK,"And I'm the man who killed the Avengers. I saw it. I didn't tell the team, how could I? I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it. The whole world, too. It's because of me. I wasn't ready. I didn't do all I could.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7198,NICK FURY,"The Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark. Playing on your fear.",Avengers: Age of Ultron

7204,THOR,I need your help.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7205,ERIK SELVIG,It's nice to be needed.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7206,THOR,It's dangerous.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7207,ERIK SELVIG,I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7208,NICK FURY,"Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time. My contacts all say he's building something. The amount of Vibranium he made off with, I don't think it's just one thing.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7209,STEVE ROGERS,What about Ultron himself?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7210,NICK FURY,"Ah. He's easy to track, he's everywhere. Guy's multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit. Still doesn't help us get an angle on any of his plans though.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7211,TONY STARK,He still going after launch codes?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7212,NICK FURY,"Yes, he is, but he's not making any headway.",Avengers: Age of Ultron

7220,NICK FURY,Parties unknown.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7221,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Do we have an ally?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7222,NICK FURY,"Ultron's got an enemy, that's not the same thing. Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7223,TONY STARK,"I might need to visit Oslo, find our ""unknown.""",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7224,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7225,NICK FURY,"I do, I have you. Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere, ears everywhere else. Here we all are, back on earth, with nothing but our wit, and our will to save the world. So stand. Outwit the platinum bastard.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7226,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7227,STEVE ROGERS,"You know what, Romanoff?",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7228,NICK FURY,So what does he want?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7229,STEVE ROGERS,To become better. Better than us. He keeps building bodies.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7230,TONY STARK,"Person bodies. The human form is inefficient, biologically speaking, we're outmoded. But he keeps coming back to it.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7231,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"When you two programmed him to protect the human race, you amazingly failed.",Avengers: Age of Ultron

7236,ULTRON,"The most versatile substance on the planet and they used it to make a Frisbee. Typical of humans, they scratch the surface and never think to look within.",Avengers: Age of Ultron

7238,TONY STARK,"Alright, strictly recon. I'll hit the NEXUS, I'll join you as soon as I can.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7239,STEVE ROGERS,If Ultron is really building a body...,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7240,TONY STARK,He'll be more powerful than any of us. Maybe all of us. An android designed by a robot.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7241,STEVE ROGERS,You know I really miss the days when the weirdest thing science ever created was me.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7242,NICK FURY,I'll drop Banner off at the tower. Do you mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7243,TONY STARK,"She's all yours, apparently. What are you gonna do?",Avengers: Age of Ultron

7245,CLINT BARTON,I'm gonna finish re-flooring that sunroom as soon as I get back.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7246,LAURA BARTON,"Yeah, and then you'll find another part of the house to tear apart.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7247,CLINT BARTON,No. It's the last project. I promise.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7248,ERIK SELVIG,This is it. The Water of Sight.,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7249,THOR,"In every realm, there's a reflection. If the water spirits accept me, I can return to my dream, and find what I missed.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7250,ERIK SELVIG,"The men who enter that water, the legends don't end well.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7251,TONY STARK,"A hacker who's faster than Ultron? He could be anywhere. And as this is the center of everything, I'm just a guy looking for a needle in the world's biggest haystack.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7252,WORLD HUB TECH,How do you find it?,Avengers: Age of Ultron
7253,TONY STARK,"Pretty simple. You bring a magnet.  Oh, I'm decrypting nuclear codes and you don't want me to. Come and get me.",Avengers: Age of Ultron

7341,JARVIS,"Hello, Dr. Banner.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7342,TONY STARK,"Ultron didn't go after JARVIS cause he was angry. He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do. So JARVIS went underground. Okay? Scattered, dumped his memory. But not his protocols. He didn't even know he was in there, until I pieced him together.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7343,BRUCE BANNER,"So, you want me to help you put JARVIS into this thing?",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7344,TONY STARK,"No, of course not! I want to help you put JARVIS in this thing.  We're out of my field here. You know bio-organics better than anyone.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7345,BRUCE BANNER,And you just assume that JARVIS' operational matrix can beat Ultron's?,Avengers: Age of Ultron

7349,TONY STARK,"I know, I know. I know what everyone's going to say, but they're already saying it. We're mad scientists. We're monsters, buddy. You gotta own it. Make a stand.  It's not a loop. It's the end of the line.",Avengers: Age of Ultron
7350,ULTRON,"I wasn't sure you'd wake up. I hoped you would, I wanted to show you something. I don't have anyone else. I think a lot about meteors, the purity of them. Boom! The end, start again. The world made clean for the new man to rebuild. I was meant to be new. I was meant to be beautiful. The world would've looked to the sky and seen hope, seen mercy. Instead they'll look up in horror because of you. You've wounded me. I give you full marks for that.
